"July 20, 2020",B,"                Synairgen soars after drug shows promise in COVID-19 cases - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Health NewsJuly 20, 2020 /  6:58 AM / a day agoSynairgen soars after drug shows promise in COVID-19 casesAakash B3 Min Read(Reuters) - Synairgen (SYNG.L) shares rose almost sixfold on Monday after the drugmaker said its medicine helped reduce the risk of severe cases in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, but some experts have cautioned against too much optimism in the market.     A study of the company’s inhalable formulation of interferon beta, SNG001, showed patients who were given the treatment had a 79% lower risk of developing severe forms of the disease caused by the new coronavirus or possible death, compared to those on a placebo.  Patients who received the drug were also more than twice as likely to recover from COVID-19, data from the trial showed. “This assessment of SNG001 in COVID-19 patients could signal a major breakthrough in the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 patients,” Synairgen Chief Executive Richard Marsden said. Shares of AIM-listed Synairgen hit a record high of 218 pence by afternoon, putting its market cap at about 326 million pounds ($412 million) compared to 54.5 million pounds on Friday. But the scientists say more data is needed to fully support the benefits of the drug, a form of naturally occurring protein which regulates the body’s antiviral responses. “There are reasons to believe it could well be an effective treatment, but these results, while encouraging, should not be taken to mean that the treatment is so dramatic that everyone should be given it,” said Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. The study had more than 100 participants from nine hospitals in Britain. Patients were evenly matched on average age, comorbidities and average duration of COVID-19 symptoms before the enrolment.     “There is a need for many more patients to be recruited and for any adverse effects to be carefully evaluated,” Evans said. The measure of breathlessness was markedly reduced in the study, said Synairgen, which was formed by three professors from the University of Southampton to focus on lung medication.

"July 20, 2020",B,"                Moscow airline passengers to be express tested for COVID-19 - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States World NewsJuly 20, 2020 /  12:37 PM / a day agoMoscow airline passengers to be express tested for COVID-192 Min ReadMOSCOW (Reuters) - Express COVID-19 testing will be available for some passengers at Russia’s busiest airport from Monday as part of a pilot project aimed at allowing air travel and tourism to resume safely.   The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport said the diagnostic tests, which give results in one hour, would be available for all passengers on domestic flights at Terminal B on Monday, as part of a wider plan to create coronavirus-free airport hubs. The portable testing system, which fits in two small suitcases, is already used at production sites by some Russian companies and was deployed at Russia’s World War Two Victory Day military parade, held on June 24, the RDIF said.  “If you’re at an airport and you need to be tested for three hours, this is not a workable solution,” RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev told Reuters in an interview last week, adding the project aims to provide test results “within an hour”.  “We are doing a pilot in an airport in Japan and in Moscow, Sheremetyevo, and in an airport in the United Arab Emirates.” Russia has not yet confirmed the date that international flights will return, with restrictions in place for many people travelling in and out of the country. But the RDIF said express coronavirus testing would be available from July 27 for domestic and international flights at Sheremetyevo’s Terminal D.  Those behind the project are hopeful that a successful trial could set an example for other major airports worldwide and allow tourism to return while ensuring passenger safety.  Russia has the world’s fourth-highest number of novel coronavirus cases at 777,486. It says 12,427 people have died from the virus.

The suspect, identified as Stephan B., is accused of murder on two counts and attempted murder in nine cases, prosecutors told reporters ahead of the trial which is scheduled to start on Tuesday. The prosecutors added that the suspect had confessed to the crimes during their investigations. The anti-Semitic gunman last October opened fire outside the synagogue in the city of Halle on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year. After failing to enter the synagogue, he fatally shot a woman passing by and a man inside a nearby kebab shop. The attacker livestreamed his attack. Interior Minster Horst Seehofer said in May that the number of anti-Semitic crimes committed in Germany rose by 13% last year, laying the blame on right-wing radicals.

FILE PHOTO: A computer image created by Nexu Science Communication together with Trinity College in Dublin, shows a model structurally representative of a betacoronavirus which is the type of virus linked to COVID-19, better known as the coronavirus linked to the current  outbreak, shared with Reuters on February 18, 2020. NEXU Science Communication/via REUTERSFull dexamethasone trial results released The full results of a large randomized clinical trial in Britain - the gold-standard of tests - looking at the steroid dexamethasone confirm the benefits in its use in COVID-19 patients that were hinted at in early findings issued last month. The results, released on Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed benefits for people with advanced or moderate disease. Overall, 2,104 COVID-19 patients were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone and 4,321 to receive usual care. Four weeks later, dexamethasone had reduced the risk of death by 36% among patients who needed mechanical ventilation when they entered the study, and by 18% among those who were receiving oxygen without mechanical ventilation. The drug did not improve survival among patients who were not using oxygen or mechanical ventilation. In an editorial, Dr. H. Clifford Lane and Dr. Anthony Fauci from the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said the results show the crucial importance of large, well-designed, carefully run, randomized controlled trials. Even during a pandemic, they said, when it might be tempting to simply ""give all therapies a chance,"" in order for patients' outcomes to improve ""there will need to be fewer small or inconclusive studies and more studies such as the dexamethasone trial."" (bit.ly/2ODqKpC; bit.ly/2CGrZlo) Immune cells may recognize the coronavirus years later Researchers in Singapore are not worried that antibodies to the novel coronavirus fade quickly. More important, they said, is that immune system cells called T cells and B cells ""remember"" the virus and can trigger an immune response. As reported on Wednesday in the journal Nature, the researchers looked for ""memory"" T cells in 36 COVID-19 survivors, 23 survivors of the 2003 coronavirus that caused SARS, and 37 people who never had either illness. All COVID-19 survivors had T cells that recognized the novel coronavirus. The SARS survivors all had T cells that remembered the 2003 virus - and their T cells also recognized the new coronavirus. Furthermore, more than half of those who were never infected with either coronavirus had protective T cells, suggesting they may have encountered other coronaviruses in the past, and there may be some pre-existing immunity to the new coronavirus in the general population. ""We find the present discussion about 'antibodies are fading away' a little pointless,"" three of the researchers told Reuters in a joint email. ""What is important is that a level of B and T cell memory remain to be present to quickly start an effective immune response able to stop viral spread,"" said Anthony Tanoto Tan of Duke-NUS Medical School, along with colleagues Nina Le Bert and Antonio Bertoletti. T cells can kill infected cells to slow the virus down, and they also help instruct B cells to produce antibodies, the researchers said. (go.nature.com/2OwM9B5) Low interferon levels identify high-risk COVID-19 Low blood levels of a type of interferon (IFN) could identify COVID-19 patients at high risk for severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Interferons are naturally occurring proteins that help the body's immune system fight infection. In a study published on Monday in the journal Science, researchers found that severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients had severely impaired production of IFN type I, persistent virus in the blood and an excessive inflammatory response. They said the findings support the potential value of treating these patients early on with IFN, combined with anti-inflammatory drugs or steroids such as dexamethasone in the most severely ill people. They also found that low plasma levels of type-I IFN were seen before patients began to deteriorate and require intensive care. ""Levels of circulating Type 1 IFN could even characterize each stage of disease, with the lowest levels observed in the most severe patients,"" they said in a news release. (bit.ly/2WzyAoP) Heart disease may underlie mysterious blood findings in COVID-19 patients Severe COVID-19 predominantly affects the lungs, but elevated blood levels of troponin, a protein released during heart injury, also are common. To learn more, cardiologists in London performed cardiovascular magnetic resonance scans in COVID-19 survivors who had at least mildly elevated troponin levels while hospitalized. Among 29 people with no obvious reason for elevated troponin, such as a heart attack, they found two patterns of myocarditis, or heart muscle inflammation. In patients with one pattern, heart function seemed unaffected. These patients should undergo cardiology follow-up to monitor for any potential long-term consequences, Dr. Dan Knight of the Royal Free Hospital told Reuters. The other pattern, seen in roughly a third of patients, was associated with reduced blood supply to the heart, or ischemic heart disease. Many patients in this group ""had important coronary artery disease which was previously unknown but required further treatment"" that would not have been offered had troponin levels not been investigated, Knight said. The main message, Knight added, is that when troponin levels are elevated in COVID-19 patients with no apparent reason, further workup could reveal undiagnosed heart disease.

The U.S. Postal Service’s losses have soared even as it has become more critical to the U.S. economy as consumers, confined to their homes because of coronavirus, shop by mail. A determination to avoid crowds will also mean that voting by mail will be more popular this November. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Trump appointee who took office in June, has detailed changes to the service that include eliminating overtime, even if it means that mail delivery is delayed. “While these changes in a normal year would be drastic, in a presidential election year when many states are relying heavily on absentee mail-in ballots, increases in mail delivery timing would impair the ability of ballots to be received and counted in a timely manner — an unacceptable outcome for a free and fair election,” wrote Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, chair of a government operations subcommittee; Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, chair of a national security subcommittee; as well as Representatives Stephen Lynch and Brenda Lawrence. The letter to DeJoy was dated Monday. The U.S. Postal Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Postal Service has been struggling as email and social media have replaced letters and after a 2006 law required it to pre-fund employee pension and retirement health care costs for the next 75 years. It is funded through services and postage. President Donald Trump has frequently criticized the post office, saying it charges too little to deliver packages sent by online retailers such as Amazon.com, whose founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post.

As recently as January, growth was forecast at 6.8% in 2020, but business activity plummeted after borders closed and a curfew and social distancing rules were imposed to curb the virus, which has infected over 6,600 and killed 108. “This is the challenge we must now face: to fight to preserve our lives and our health, and to resume all our productive activities to get our economy back on track,” Sall said in a speech to the nation. The state of emergency and a night-time curfew will be lifted as of Tuesday 2300 local time, and air borders will open from July 15 under certain conditions, he said. The authorities have already loosened the curfew and allowed inter-regional travel in response to street protests against the measures earlier in June. Sall said the government was working on an economic support programme to kickstart recovery.

REUTERS/Dustin ChambersBy Rich McKay ATLANTA (Reuters) - Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial, a nine-story-high bas-relief sculpture carved into a sprawling rock face northeast of Atlanta, is perhaps the South’s most audacious monument to its pro-slavery legacy still intact.  Despite long-standing demands for the removal of what many consider to be a shrine to racism, the giant depiction of three Confederate heroes on horseback still towers ominously over the Georgia countryside, protected by state law.   The monument - which reopens on Independence Day weekend after the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to close for weeks - has faced renewed calls for removal since the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a Black man who died during an arrest by a white police officer who pinned his neck to the ground with a knee.  The brutality of Floyd’s death, captured on cellphone video, triggered a national outcry against racial injustice, and revived a long-simmering battle between those demanding the removal of racist symbols from the public sphere, and those who believe the monuments honor Southern tradition and history. “Here we are in Atlanta, the birthplace of the Civil Rights Movement, and still we have the largest Confederate monument in the world,” said Gerald Griggs, a vice president of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP civil rights group, which staged a march last week calling for the carving to be scraped from the mountainside. “It’s time for our state to get on the right side of history.” The sheer scale of the monument makes its removal a daunting task to contemplate. Longer than a 100-yard American football field, it features the likenesses of  Jefferson Davis, the president of the 11-state Confederacy, and two of its legendary military leaders, Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, notched in a relief 400 feet above ground.  The Sons of Confederate Veterans is an organization that  staunchly defends Stone Mountain and other Confederate statues and emblems. Dedicated to teaching the “Southern Cause,” according to its website, it believes their removal is akin to purging American history. The Southern or “Lost Cause of the Confederacy” holds that the war was fought over a heroic, but lost, effort to defend states’ rights to secede from the Union in the face of Northern aggression, rather than the preservation of slavery. Martin O’Toole, an official of the Georgia chapter, said the monument is not a totem of racism at all. It’s history, plain and simple, he says. “It’s three men on horses,” O’Toole said. “What’s racist about that?” Maurice J. Hobson, an associate professor of African American Studies at Georgia State University, counters this, describing the Southern Cause as “a false history” that downplays slavery’s role in the Civil War.  He said the Confederate leaders were traitors to the United States who fought to hold on to a Southern economy that depended on slavery. All three men featured on the monument, Davis, Lee and Jackson, were slave owners. “The whole of Stone Mountain was erected to show what some white Georgians revered,” he said.  Stone Mountain has long held symbolism for white supremacists. The Ku Klux Klan, a hate group that was formed by Confederate Army veterans and has a history of lynchings and terror against Black people, held its rebirth ceremony atop the mountain in 1915 with flaming crosses. Klansmen still hold occasional gatherings in the shadows of the edifice, albeit now met with protesters behind police tape. Many of those cross-burnings took place on or around July 4. The monolithic monument was proposed more than a century ago and had numerous false starts over the years. But with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, segregationist officials in the state pushed for the creation of the Stone Mountain Memorial Association in 1958 and purchased the park. The carving was completed in 1972. “This debate has been going on for years, and we’re sensitive to it,” John Bankhead, a spokesman for the group, said. “We want to tell history as it is, not as some say it is.” In the past, others have suggested putting more balance into the monument. There was a proposal to build a memorial to Martin Luther King Jr., the Atlanta-based civil rights icon, but the Sons of Confederate Veterans, as well the King family, rejected the idea. Even though that idea floundered, Hobson advocates adding more carvings to the rock face, including African American historical figures and leaders. Slideshow (2 Images)“It needs to be put in a context that forces a conversation, a serious conversation,” he said. “The easiest way to rectify it, is surround it.”  Griggs of the NAACP said that the civil rights group has consulted with stone masons who said it would cost about $300,000 to $400,000 to remove the towering images. “Take it down,” he said. “Restore the mountain to its original condition.”   Reporting by Rich McKay; Editing by Frank McGurty and Aurora EllisOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

FILE PHOTO: A man speaks into a bullhorn while pointing at the Confederate Monument carved into granite on Stone Mountain while protesting the monument at Stone Mountain Park in Stone Mountain, Georgia, U.S. June 16, 2020. REUTERS/Dustin ChambersVideo footage of the Independence Day rally posted on social media showed scores of demonstrators dressed in black - many in paramilitary-style clothing and all wearing face scarves - quietly parading several abreast down a sidewalk at the park.  Many of the protesters carried rifles, including military-type weapons, and some wore ammunition belts slung over their shoulders. Although African Americans appeared to account for the vast majority of the marchers, protesters of various races, men and women alike, were among the group. One video clip showed a leader of the demonstrators, who was not identified, shouting into a loudspeaker in a challenge to white supremacists who historically have used Stone Mountain as a rallying spot of their own. “I don’t see no white militia,” he declared. “We’re here. Where ... you at? We’re in your house. Let’s go.” John Bankhead, a spokesman for the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, said the protesters were peaceful and orderly. “It’s a public park, a state park. We have these protests on both sides of the issue from time to time. We respect people’s First Amendment right,” Bankhead told NBC affiliate station WXIA-TV. “We understand the sensitivities of the issue here at the park ... so we respect that and allow them to come in as long as it’s peaceful, which it has been.” Stone Mountain, which reopened for the holiday weekend following a weeks-long closure over the coronavirus, has faced renewed calls for its removal since the May 25 death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. Floyd’s killing helped revive a long-simmering conflict between groups seeking to do away with Confederate statues and sculptures, which they see as pro-slavery symbols, and those who believe they honor the traditions and history of the Deep South. Nine stories high and spanning the length of a football field, the bas-relief Stone Mountain sculpture carved into a granite wall overlooking the Georgia countryside some 25 miles (40 km) east of Atlanta remains the largest such monument to America’s Civil War Confederacy. It features the likenesses of Jefferson Davis, who was president of the 11-state Confederacy, and two of his legendary generals, Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson. Stone Mountain has long held symbolism for white supremacists. The Ku Klux Klan, a hate group that was formed by Confederate Army veterans and has a history of lynchings and terror against Black people, held its rebirth ceremony atop mountain in 1915 with flaming crosses. Klansmen still hold occasional gatherings in the shadows of the edifice, albeit now met with protesters behind police tape. Many of those cross-burnings took place on or around July 4.

"July 17, 2020",BA,"                End of the jumbo: British Airways retires 747 early due to coronavirus crisis - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsJuly 17, 2020 /  1:26 AM / 4 days agoEnd of the jumbo: British Airways retires 747 early due to coronavirus crisisSarah Young, Maria Ponnezhath, Tim Hepher4 Min Read(Reuters) - British Airways, the world’s largest operator of Boeing 747s, will retire its entire jumbo jet fleet with immediate effect after the COVID-19 pandemic sent air travel into freefall. For over 50 years, Boeing’s (BA.N) “Queen of the Skies” has been the world’s most easily recognised jetliner with its humped fuselage and four engines. But its days were already numbered before the pandemic struck earlier this year.  British Airways (BA) had been planning to retire the aircraft in 2024, but with passenger numbers decimated this year, and experts forecasting it will be years before they recover, the airline said it was unlikely its 747s would operate commercially again.  “It is with great sadness that we can confirm we are proposing to retire our entire 747 fleet with immediate effect,” BA said in a statement on Thursday.  The 747 democratised global air travel in the 1970s, but fell behind modern twin-engine aircraft and now trails newer planes in fuel efficiency, making it expensive to run.  The move by BA comes after Australia’s Qantas Airways (QAN.AX) said in June it would retire its remaining 747 fleet immediately, six months ahead of schedule. BA’s predecessor airline BOAC first introduced the 747 on the London-New York route in 1971 after a one-year delay caused by a dispute with pilots over the terms for flying the new jet. Hugh Dibley, a former BOAC captain and racing driver who joined the airline in 1958, said the 747’s introduction marked a new era, but was beset with teething problems with its engines. Landing and taxiing also took some getting used to, from a cockpit positioned almost 30 feet above the ground - or more when angling the nose higher just before touching the runway. “It was a delight to fly as it was so stable. The initial issue was its height from the ground. It was like landing a block of flats from the 2nd floor,” Dibley told Reuters. BA’s jumbos are the 747-400 model, the most-sold version of the jet which was introduced in 1989. After BA, only a handful of airlines including Rossiya Airlines and Air China continue to operate them, according to Cirium data. A newer version, the 747-8, was designed to refresh the  brand and counter Airbus’s A380, but has mainly prospered as a freighter and Boeing is soon expected to follow Airbus in announcing a halt to production of such four-engined behemoths. Slideshow (5 Images)The end of the runway for BA’s jumbo fleet comes as the company, owned by IAG (ICAG.L), faces a battle for survival because of the coronavirus pandemic. Just as its introduction at BA was marred by labour uncertainty, its retirement almost five decades later comes as BA plans to cut up to 12,000 jobs, or 28% of its workforce, to prepare for a slump in air travel. U.S.-based Boeing and its suppliers signalled the end of the plane when they set the final number of parts it would need for the 747 jumbo jet programme at least a year ago.

Global curbs imposed to stem the spread of the virus led to a turbulence in air travel, placing the future of many airline companies in doubt. “It is unlikely our magnificent ‘queen of the skies’ will ever operate commercial services for British Airways again,” the company said in a statement. BA, which is owned by International Consolidated Airlines Group, added that it will operate more flights on modern, fuel-efficient aircraft such as its new A350s and 787s and expects such aircraft to help in achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. A wave of restructuring triggered by the virus outbreak is hitting airlines and industrial firms across the world. The Sun reported last month that BA had reached an agreement with its pilots to sack 350 and another 300 in ‘pool’ for rehiring when needed. The majority of pilots being ‘pooled’ were expected to be the jumbo jet first officers, according to the report. Boeing Co’s 747, a plane that democratized global air travel in the 1970s but fell behind modern twin-engine aircraft, marked its 50-year flying anniversary in February 2019. The U.S.-based aerospace company and its suppliers signalled the end of the plane, when they set the final number of parts it would need for the 747 jumbo jet program at least a year ago. However, the decision was left in limbo for years amid falling orders and pricing pressure.

"June 5, 2020",BABA,"                Goldman Sachs executive's email making plea for racial equality goes viral at firm - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsJune 5, 2020 /  2:16 AM / 2 months agoGoldman Sachs executive's email making plea for racial equality goes viral at firmImani Moise, Sinead Cruise4 Min Read(Reuters) - An email by a Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) employee about his experiences of racial injustice and criticizing managers at the Wall Street bank for not supporting junior bankers from diverse backgrounds went viral at the firm this week. FILE PHOTO: The Goldman Sachs company logo is seen in the company's space on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., April 17, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoThe email by Frederick Baba, a managing director at the bank who is black, coincides with other Wall Street executives and companies speaking out against racial inequality after the death of an African American man, George Floyd, during an arrest by a white police officer who held a knee on his neck in Minneapolis on May 25. On Tuesday, Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) pledged $1 billion to help communities address economic and racial inequality. Goldman Sachs on Wednesday created a $10 million fund for racial equity. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Citigroup (C.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) have also made statements denouncing racism and discrimination. Baba, who works in Goldman’s electronic trading business, according to his LinkedIn, initially sent the email with the subject line “How it’s going...” to a group of bankers he works with on June 2 after Floyd’s death led to sometimes violent protests across the United States. But the letter ended up being so widely forwarded that it was seen by almost everyone at the bank - which employs around 38,000 people globally - including CEO David Solomon, according to a source familiar with the matter.  Solomon emailed Baba with a personal note in response, the person said without elaborating on what Solomon wrote. The letter has been posted on Goldman’s internal website, the person said.  “To everyone who’s asked me some variant of “how’s it going?” over the past month, I’ve probably lied. Or lacked the words to articulate it fully, but I’m giving it a shot,” Baba wrote in the email seen by Reuters. “...the past few months have been demoralizing, and family/friends/colleagues I’ve spoken with and listened to across the firm and country seem to share this feeling,” he wrote, going on to mention minorities hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Baba goes on to draw a detailed account of his experiences witnessing and being subjected to racial discrimination and aggression, including a 2011 encounter with Chicago police. Baba said the Chicago police slammed him against the hood of a cruiser because he matched the generic description of a black man wearing a t-shirt and shorts. “I went home and I cried for the first time in years,” he wrote.  At the end of the letter, Baba calls on his colleagues to take action to counter racial inequality, including at work.  Related Coverage'How it's going ...'

Goldman executive's email on racial inequality in America12 Min Read(Reuters) - Frederick Baba, a managing director at Goldman Sachs who is black, sent the following email to colleagues at the bank on June 2:  FILE PHOTO - A sign is displayed in the reception of Goldman Sachs in Sydney, Australia, May 18, 2016.   REUTERS/David Gray/File Photo“To everyone who’s asked me some variant of “how’s it going?” over the past month, I’ve probably lied. Or lacked the words to articulate it fully, but I’m giving it a shot. Obviously my experience is just one along a continuum of black experiences, and I don’t presume to speak for all black people (or even all black people at Goldman Sachs). But the past few months have been demoralizing, and family/friends/colleagues I’ve spoken with and listened to across the firm and country seem to share this feeling. Being black has been nothing if not instructive. I’ve learned history and why people live where they do and why those in positions of power often don’t look like me. I’ve learned that bad things are more likely to happen to black people solely because they’re black. I learned which of my friends’ parents didn’t want me in the house growing up and who would be blamed if my friends broke the law. I’ve learned how to prove intelligent, to prove not threatening, to prove innocent after being assumed guilty. To prove human as this country litigates my personhood in case after case. As if our lives are expendable but we could never rebuild a Louis Vuitton store or a burned out Target. As if MLK’s nonviolent philosophy allowed him to opt-out of death by white supremacy. As if COVID ravaging minority communities is an acceptable, inevitable cost, and our lives just aren’t worth the points off GDP. It’s a lot. “My family immigrated to the US in 1990; this weekend I realized that my earliest memory in the US was the assault on Rodney King (where a group of LAPD officers struck an unarmed citizen some 50 times and kicked him 8 times during a traffic stop in March 1991). The officers involved lied about the incident, which was captured on film by an amateur photographer. I remember seeing the video, footage from the protests, and King’s famous “can we all get along?” statement. Four officers were charged; all were eventually acquitted. Two weeks prior Soon Ja Du, an LA convenience store owner shot 15 year old Latasha Harlins in the back of the head. Du accused Harlins of attempting to steal a $1.79 bottle of orange juice; Harlins had cash-in-hand and police concluded that Harlins intended to pay. Du accused Harlins of stealing and grabbed her arm, Harlins punched Du, and Du shot Harlins as she attempted to leave the store. The jury found Du guilty of voluntary manslaughter and recommended the maximum sentence of sixteen years jail time. The trial judge overruled the jury recommendation, stating that Du behaved “inappropriately” but understandably. Du was sentenced to five years’ probation, 400 hours of community service, and a $500 fine. An appeals court upheld the ruling 3-0 on April 21, 1992. A week later all four officers were acquitted in the King case, kicking off six days of protests which resulted in 63 deaths and eclipsed the city’s Watts protests of 1965. As then the situation centered around violence against people of color with seeming impunity. “A decade later, while I was living in Cincinnati, 19-year old Timothy Thomas was killed by a Cincinnati Police officer during a police pursuit in April of 2001. Thomas was pursued for 10 minutes by nine officers over 14 non-violent minor offenses, of which 12 were traffic violations. Thomas suddenly came in contact with a CPD officer, surprised, shot and killed Thomas at point blank range. The officer allegedly believed that Thomas was reaching for a gun, although subsequent investigations determined that he was likely adjusting his baggy pants. As is common in these cases, Thomas’s life and death hinged on an officer’s distinction between being uncomfortable and being afraid. And like many of these cases, the officer’s claimed belief of bodily danger legitimized the use of deadly force. The protests lasted five days and centered around Cincinnati’s Over-the-Rhine district, which was a predominantly black, heavily policed community where the shooting took place. The median household income in Over-the-Rhine was about $8,600 at the time but has since become whiter and wealthier through to gentrification. The Thomas incident also kicked off a local debate sometimes described as “respectability politics,” with some black leaders blaming black culture for Thomas’s death and advocating behavioral changes. The issue was not the extra-judicial killing of a US citizen over “driving without a license” citations; it was a lack of respect for law and order. If we as black people changed our behavior, pulled our pants up, and were respectable, all our problems would be answered. If our parents took a firmer hand, beat us when needed, and policed our behavior, law enforcement officials wouldn’t have to. But NYPD officers discharged 41 rounds Amadou Diallo despite his being unarmed and having committed no crime. “A decade later in November 2011, while I was living in Chicago I was leaving a rec-league dodge ball game when I was approached by two Chicago police officers. They asked where I was coming from and I explained. They then then told me that I matched the description of an individual who had reportedly stolen from a residence in the area. The description was a black male in shorts and a t-shirt; nothing else. No color for either article of clothing, and in a city with just under 1 million black people I was obviously the culprit. I’d clearly spent too much time around hyper-rational people who respected me and knew where I went to school and how much money made. In a lapse of judgment I tried to explain how absurd it all was while presenting my ID and found myself slammed against the hood of a police cruiser. The officer who shoved me looked afraid more than anything, and while I was confident I could have taken both in a fair fight guns are scary so I worked to de-escalate the situation. I was basically living out my nightmare of at least the past 10 years, where I’d decide whether to deploy lethal force to defend myself from law enforcement. I’d previously decided that if things went left I would fight, rush to my apartment, call the legal counsel at my employer, and negotiate turning myself in. Fortunately de-escalating worked; the officers patted me down, jostled me a bit, emptied the contents of my wallet into the street one-by-one, and detained me for another ~20 minutes of shivering (I was in shorts and a t-shirt, standing outside in Chicago on a November evening). They finally let me go when another officer (possibly their superior) asked what they were doing and said ‘That’s not him.’ “I went home and I cried for the first time in years. Then I filed a report with the Chicago Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA), complaint #1050215. Then I flew to London for a work trip, noted how well the Brits treated class-signaling blacks (obviously not the full story), and considered never coming back. But I returned to Chicago and gave an in-person statement. And I waited. And in February 2012 Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman. And I waited. And George Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013, impetus for the Black Lives Matter movement. And the head of IPRA resigned in 2013. And IPRA closed my complaint file claiming that their “findings of the events that occurred differed from the account provided” without further detail. And in June 2014 I moved to New York to start a new job at Goldman Sachs. And in July of 2014 Eric Garner was killed by NYPD officers who approached him on suspicion of selling “loosies” (individual cigarettes) without the proper tax stamps (the New York City + State excise tax is $5.85 for a pack of 20 cigarettes). In August of 2014 Michael Brown was killed after allegedly stealing a box of Swisher Sweet cigarillos (approx. value $15), initiating several weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri. “And in 2015 news broke that the Chicago PD had been running a “black-site” undisclosed interrogation facility in the Homan Square neighborhood where over 7,000 civilians were detained since 2004; 80% of the detainees were black Americans. And the new head of IPRA resigned. And a city of Chicago lawyer resigned after burying evidence related to the killing of Darius Pinex by two CPD officers in 2011. The previous ruling (in which the shooting was deemed justified) was later thrown out, and a retrial was ordered. “And some years passed, and the story played out several more times. And in 2018 Lorenzo Davis, a former IPRA investigator was awarded a $2.8mm settlement after a Cook County jury found that he was fired after refusing to change his recommendations re: police shootings he deemed unjustified (which was good-ish). And some years passed. And on February 23, 2020, Ahmaud Arbery was ambushed and killed by a former police officer and his son in Glynn County, Georgia. On March 13, 2020 Breonna Taylor was killed by Louisville Metro Police officers serving a ‘no-knock warrant’ related to two individuals already in police custody. Kenneth Walker (Taylor’s partner at the time) fired upon the officers with a licensed and then called 911 to report the home invasion and shooting of his girlfriend. Kenneth was initially charged with first-degree assault and attempted murder of a police officer (charges were dropped in May 2020). George Floyd was killed on May 25, 2020 after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds (while Floyd was hand-cuffed and lying face down). Floyd was extra-judicially killed on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a local market. And some NYPD SUVs drove through a crowd on Saturday. And some Minnesota police officers screamed “Light ‘em up!” before firing on a woman and her family while they stood on their front porch in accordance with the curfew. “So as to how it’s going- it’s not great. Fred “p.s. That was heavy huh? Thanks for reading! I appreciate that many of you will seek to reach out, express solidarity, etc. And while that would be greatly appreciated, here are some things I’d appreciate even more: - Reaching out to and supporting diverse analysts and associates within the firm; a common bit of feedback from our junior colleagues is that while our firm expresses a commitment to equality and social justice up top, they don’t necessarily see commitment and support from their direct managers (the VPs and MDs they interact with more regularly). I’ll be okay; look after them. - Donate money to advocacy organizations (don’t want to violate firm policy here; MDs+ feel free to reach out for recommendations, happy to brainstorm with everyone else). Also worth noting that there are six times as many white Americans as black Americans (suspect even more skewed at GS). The more people we can get off the sidelines, the better. - Donate time to same (obviously we’re all busy, isolating, etc; I wish I were better about this myself. Same point as above applies) - Support minority-owned businesses. Policing is closely tied to class, just as socioeconomics are closely tied to race. Our society naturally defends vested economic interests, and while it won’t solve everything economic empowerment and sociopolitical empowerment are closely linked.

REUTERS/Sunil Kataria/File PhotoBaba Ramdev, co-founder of Patanjali and a household name in India, launched Coronil to much fanfare on Tuesday, but hit a roadblock when New Delhi and some state governments expressed scepticism. The western state of Maharashtra banned the drug. “Maharashtra won’t allow the sale of spurious medicine,” state minister Anil Deshmukh tweeted on Thursday, adding authorities would probe whether any clinical trials had been run. Deshmukh could not be reached for a comment. Patanjali did not immediately respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment. Hours after its launch, India’s federal government asked Patanjali to provide details about Coronil, trials and sample size and asked the company to stop advertising the product until it had been approved. Ramdev, who is seen as a supporter of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said at the launch that the medicine consisted of ancient Ayurvedic ingredients that boost immunity and had a 100% cure rate. India reported a record increase of nearly 17,000 coronavirus infections on Thursday, taking the total to 473,105 with 14,894 deaths. Maharashtra, home to India’s financial hub of Mumbai, has been the hardest hit by the pandemic, accounting for more than 25% of cases. The state reported some 3,890 new infections on Thursday, taking its tally up to 142,900 cases. It has recorded 6,739 deaths.

Businesses ask: where's the money? - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsApril 27, 2020 /  2:56 PM / 3 months agoItaly wants to reopen. Businesses ask: where's the money?Valentina Za, Stefano Bernabei, Andrea Mandala8 Min ReadAMELIA, Italy (Reuters) - When the COVID-19 pandemic forced Roberto Ferraro to shut the patisserie he runs in Amelia, a scenic hilltop town in central Italy, he had just rented out a new site to increase production of ice cream and start selling it abroad. Ferraro would like to be preparing his business to reopen in the weeks to come, working out how to secure supplies and ensure social distancing among customers. Instead, the 51-year-old is devoting his time and energy to wading through the pile of documents he must file with banks to tap state-guaranteed loans.    His struggles are just one example of how red tape is holding up the state aid needed to keep companies afloat in the euro zone’s third-largest economy and a country that has suffered Europe’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak. “When can I get the money? The banks don’t know. It depends - days, weeks, they don’t know,” Ferraro said. “In March we paid electricity bills and wages even though the government had closed us down and, unlike supermarkets, we couldn’t sell Easter cakes.” Rome’s problems getting money to businesses are reflected, to a greater or lesser degree, in other countries under coronavirus restrictions around the world, from the United Kingdom to the United States. Italy, the first Western nation to shut down, is now in the vanguard of moves to cautiously reopen its economy. From May 4, shops like Ferraro’s can provide takeaways, and they will fully restart from June 1.  But the aid deployment figures so far are worrying for business leaders and politicians alike. The government says debt guarantees made available by the state can unlock up to 740 billion euros ($803 billion) in funding for businesses which have been crippled by a seven-week lockdown. So far just 3.1 billion euros in funds have been released, the Treasury said at the weekend. Of that, only 115 million euros are in the form of loans worth up to 25,000 euros fully secured by the state, which do not require banks to perform credit analyses on borrowers. The financial stakes are higher for Italy than many others in Europe because its economy was faltering even before COVID-19, and the pandemic hit hardest in the northern industrial heartlands that generate a third of its output.  If loan lifelines arrive too late for the 2.1 million firms which have been unable to operate, Rome will likely fail to prevent a raft of bankruptcies despite aid spending which is set to push public debt to 156% of GDP this year, economists say. “One of the most controversial aspects of the measures is the impression the government gave that the money was just sitting there and all people had to do was turn up at their bank,” said Salvo Politino, deputy president of business lobby Unimpresa. Related CoverageFactbox: Some Italian companies resume work as coronavirus curbs easedThe Italian Treasury declined to comment.  Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri has rebuffed criticism over the liquidity measures, saying they are immediately effective and provide “impressive firepower”. RUM-SOAKED BABA Before the pandemic, the popularity of Ferraro’s rum-soaked “baba” cake whose secrets he had learnt in his native Naples, had allowed his business to expand without any bank debt in the five years since he opened.  He is now applying for two different types of state- guaranteed loans, including a fully-guaranteed one.     The rollout for such loans started last week, triggering a flood of complaints about bureaucracy and prompting banking lobby ABI to tell lenders to stop demanding unnecessary documents and to not ask borrowers to repay existing debts with the new loans. That represents a big cultural shift for an industry that has spent most of the past decade sweeping balance sheets clean of unpaid loans after coming under fire from supervisors for lending too freely. Ferraro, who declined to say how much he was seeking, said both banks he applied to had asked for his earnings statements for 2019 and 2018, which are not required under the government’s decree.         His experience echoes those of other businesses struggling to survive as Italy’s economy sinks into its fourth recession in a decade, with an expected 8% contraction this year. Mara Bartolini, 42, the owner of a gift store in Cremona, in the northern Lombardy region which has borne the brunt of the outbreak, said her bank had told her it may take two to four weeks to get the fully-guaranteed loan. At the other end of Italy’s boot, Michele Mandala has also been told to wait a month for the money he needs because he does not expect to be able to reopen his cinema theatre in the Sicilian town of Caltanissetta until after the summer. A view of the tiled roofs of Amelia, the small town in Italy's central Umbria region where Roberto Ferraro used to bake his cakes before the coronavirus outbreak shut down his pastry shop, is seen in this undated handout photo. Riccardo Passagrilli/Handout via REUTERS   LIQUIDITY TAP Bank officials say they simply cannot cope with the workload after being hit by debt moratorium requests, which the Bank of Italy says amount so far to 1.3 million for more than 140 billion euros in loans. The government fund that provides some of the guarantees on loans has advised banks to upload requests in bulk at nighttime, when online traffic slows. Banks must assess creditworthiness, as they bear part of the risk, yet the COVID-19 crisis makes it hard to gauge the ability of borrowers to repay their debt. Lenders say they face legal risk under Italian law because they can be held liable for credit abuse or aiding bankruptcy if a debtor defaults. “The problem is that only drops are coming out of the government’s liquidity tap,” said Roberto Sambuco, a partner at leading financial advisory firm Vitale&Co. Besides the 100% guarantee on the smaller loans, Italy provides a 90% guarantee on up to 800,000 euros, which can rise to 100% with co-insurance schemes. It guarantees between 70% and 90% of larger loans, depending on the size of the company. Sambuco said the government had to modify the package to make the process more direct, like it is in France, the United States or in Switzerland where loans of up to 500,000 Swiss francs ($514,000) are fully guaranteed.  “The risk that tens of thousands of firms may just die of thirst is significant. The situation is much more serious than measures put in place by the government can remedy.” The ABI is, meanwhile, calling for a legal shield from prosecution at least for loans worth up to 100,000 euros. HOW TO REPAY? In a study by three of its economists, the Bank of Italy said direct state transfers, without an obligation for companies to pay them back, would be necessary. The U.S. government is offering loans that can be forgiven if most of the money is used for payroll costs. Italy has also said it plans to introduce them but its public finances, already stretched to the limit, leave little room for manoeuvre.  Sambuco said Rome would need help from the European Union and not just from the European Central Bank. “Without the EU umbrella we don’t have the necessary resources,” he said.  Slideshow (2 Images)EU leaders agreed on Thursday to build a trillion-euro emergency fund to help the bloc recover from the pandemic but postponed any decision on divisive details until the summer. Their jockeying is a world away from Ferraro in Amelia who, like many other businesses, faces having to take on loans with little idea of how the economy will fare. “I’m venturing abroad, but those who are betting on Italy getting back on its feet, how are they going to repay all this debt two years from now if that recovery is nowhere to be seen?”  Additional reporting by Giuseppe Fonte and Emilio Parodi; Editing by Pravin CharOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Its popularity comes amid calls for a boycott of Chinese mobile apps in India as a Himalayan border dispute fuels a backlash against products from China. Popular Indian yoga guru Baba Ramdev posted a video on Twitter on Sunday showing the step-by-step deletion of several Chinese apps, a move he described as a “national service”. Chinese companies have faced occasional opposition for years in India, where some supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party advocate self reliance. Remove China Apps, whose logo contains a dragon’s head with two brooms, scans a user’s phone for apps such as ByteDance’s TikTok and Alibaba’s UC Browser. Once deleted, a message pops up saying, “You are awesome, no China app found.” OneTouch AppLabs, which has developed the app to remove Chinese ones, did not respond to a request for comment. The company, based in the western Indian city of Jaipur, describes the app as its first initiative toward a “self reliant India”. ByteDance and Alibaba did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the app. The Chinese Embassy in New Delhi did not immediately respond. The protest against Chinese apps comes after India in April said stricter screening rules will apply to foreign direct investments from China, worrying investors there. China has said the policy is discriminatory. “Previous boycott calls have focused on Chinese goods, whereas this one especially targets Chinese apps, which could impact Chinese technology companies who have seen India as a crucial market,” said Tanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who closely tracks Indo-China relations. The stakes are high for firms like ByteDance, which plans to invest $1 billion in India and has recently ramped up hiring. India, which has a population of 1.3 billion, is the biggest driver of installations of ByteDance’s TikTok, which Bollywood actor Milind Soman said last week on Twitter that he was no longer using. Nupur Sharma, a spokeswoman for Modi’s party, said it was “great to see concerned citizens setting an example”. “We ought to hit them where it hurts most,” Sharma said on Twitter, using the hashtag, #BoycottChineseProducts. A senior executive working for a China-based company in India, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Chinese firms were contributing to the Indian economy, especially the manufacturing sector. He predicted the protests will be short-lived: “It hurts but (the boycott calls) are going to fade.” (Reporting by Aditya Kalra; Editing by Euan Rocha and Alexander Smith)Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Goldman executive's email on racial inequality in America12 Min ReadJune 4 (Reuters) - Frederick Baba, a managing director at Goldman Sachs who is black, sent the following email to colleagues at the bank on June 2: “To everyone who’s asked me some variant of “how’s it going?” over the past month, I’ve probably lied. Or lacked the words to articulate it fully, but I’m giving it a shot. Obviously my experience is just one along a continuum of black experiences, and I don’t presume to speak for all black people (or even all black people at Goldman Sachs). But the past few months have been demoralizing, and family/friends/colleagues I’ve spoken with and listened to across the firm and country seem to share this feeling. Being black has been nothing if not instructive. I’ve learned history and why people live where they do and why those in positions of power often don’t look like me. I’ve learned that bad things are more likely to happen to black people solely because they’re black. I learned which of my friends’ parents didn’t want me in the house growing up and who would be blamed if my friends broke the law. I’ve learned how to prove intelligent, to prove not threatening, to prove innocent after being assumed guilty. To prove human as this country litigates my personhood in case after case. As if our lives are expendable but we could never rebuild a Louis Vuitton store or a burned out Target. As if MLK’s nonviolent philosophy allowed him to opt-out of death by white supremacy. As if COVID ravaging minority communities is an acceptable, inevitable cost, and our lives just aren’t worth the points off GDP. It’s a lot. “My family immigrated to the US in 1990; this weekend I realized that my earliest memory in the US was the assault on Rodney King (where a group of LAPD officers struck an unarmed citizen some 50 times and kicked him 8 times during a traffic stop in March 1991). The officers involved lied about the incident, which was captured on film by an amateur photographer. I remember seeing the video, footage from the protests, and King’s famous “can we all get along?” statement. Four officers were charged; all were eventually acquitted. Two weeks prior Soon Ja Du, an LA convenience store owner shot 15 year old Latasha Harlins in the back of the head. Du accused Harlins of attempting to steal a $1.79 bottle of orange juice; Harlins had cash-in-hand and police concluded that Harlins intended to pay. Du accused Harlins of stealing and grabbed her arm, Harlins punched Du, and Du shot Harlins as she attempted to leave the store. The jury found Du guilty of voluntary manslaughter and recommended the maximum sentence of sixteen years jail time. The trial judge overruled the jury recommendation, stating that Du behaved “inappropriately” but understandably. Du was sentenced to five years’ probation, 400 hours of community service, and a $500 fine. An appeals court upheld the ruling 3-0 on April 21, 1992. A week later all four officers were acquitted in the King case, kicking off six days of protests which resulted in 63 deaths and eclipsed the city’s Watts protests of 1965. As then the situation centered around violence against people of color with seeming impunity. “A decade later, while I was living in Cincinnati, 19-year old Timothy Thomas was killed by a Cincinnati Police officer during a police pursuit in April of 2001. Thomas was pursued for 10 minutes by nine officers over 14 non-violent minor offenses, of which 12 were traffic violations. Thomas suddenly came in contact with a CPD officer, surprised, shot and killed Thomas at point blank range. The officer allegedly believed that Thomas was reaching for a gun, although subsequent investigations determined that he was likely adjusting his baggy pants. As is common in these cases, Thomas’s life and death hinged on an officer’s distinction between being uncomfortable and being afraid. And like many of these cases, the officer’s claimed belief of bodily danger legitimized the use of deadly force. The protests lasted five days and centered around Cincinnati’s Over-the-Rhine district, which was a predominantly black, heavily policed community where the shooting took place. The median household income in Over-the-Rhine was about $8,600 at the time but has since become whiter and wealthier through to gentrification. The Thomas incident also kicked off a local debate sometimes described as “respectability politics,” with some black leaders blaming black culture for Thomas’s death and advocating behavioral changes. The issue was not the extra-judicial killing of a US citizen over “driving without a license” citations; it was a lack of respect for law and order. If we as black people changed our behavior, pulled our pants up, and were respectable, all our problems would be answered. If our parents took a firmer hand, beat us when needed, and policed our behavior, law enforcement officials wouldn’t have to. But NYPD officers discharged 41 rounds Amadou Diallo despite his being unarmed and having committed no crime. “A decade later in November 2011, while I was living in Chicago I was leaving a rec-league dodge ball game when I was approached by two Chicago police officers. They asked where I was coming from and I explained. They then then told me that I matched the description of an individual who had reportedly stolen from a residence in the area. The description was a black male in shorts and a t-shirt; nothing else. No color for either article of clothing, and in a city with just under 1 million black people I was obviously the culprit. I’d clearly spent too much time around hyper-rational people who respected me and knew where I went to school and how much money made. In a lapse of judgment I tried to explain how absurd it all was while presenting my ID and found myself slammed against the hood of a police cruiser. The officer who shoved me looked afraid more than anything, and while I was confident I could have taken both in a fair fight guns are scary so I worked to de-escalate the situation. I was basically living out my nightmare of at least the past 10 years, where I’d decide whether to deploy lethal force to defend myself from law enforcement. I’d previously decided that if things went left I would fight, rush to my apartment, call the legal counsel at my employer, and negotiate turning myself in. Fortunately de-escalating worked; the officers patted me down, jostled me a bit, emptied the contents of my wallet into the street one-by-one, and detained me for another ~20 minutes of shivering (I was in shorts and a t-shirt, standing outside in Chicago on a November evening). They finally let me go when another officer (possibly their superior) asked what they were doing and said ‘That’s not him.’ “I went home and I cried for the first time in years. Then I filed a report with the Chicago Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA), complaint #1050215. Then I flew to London for a work trip, noted how well the Brits treated class-signaling blacks (obviously not the full story), and considered never coming back. But I returned to Chicago and gave an in-person statement. And I waited. And in February 2012 Trayvon Martin was killed by George Zimmerman. And I waited. And George Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013, impetus for the Black Lives Matter movement. And the head of IPRA resigned in 2013. And IPRA closed my complaint file claiming that their “findings of the events that occurred differed from the account provided” without further detail. And in June 2014 I moved to New York to start a new job at Goldman Sachs. And in July of 2014 Eric Garner was killed by NYPD officers who approached him on suspicion of selling “loosies” (individual cigarettes) without the proper tax stamps (the New York City + State excise tax is $5.85 for a pack of 20 cigarettes). In August of 2014 Michael Brown was killed after allegedly stealing a box of Swisher Sweet cigarillos (approx. value $15), initiating several weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri. “And in 2015 news broke that the Chicago PD had been running a “black-site” undisclosed interrogation facility in the Homan Square neighborhood where over 7,000 civilians were detained since 2004; 80% of the detainees were black Americans. And the new head of IPRA resigned. And a city of Chicago lawyer resigned after burying evidence related to the killing of Darius Pinex by two CPD officers in 2011. The previous ruling (in which the shooting was deemed justified) was later thrown out, and a retrial was ordered. “And some years passed, and the story played out several more times. And in 2018 Lorenzo Davis, a former IPRA investigator was awarded a $2.8mm settlement after a Cook County jury found that he was fired after refusing to change his recommendations re: police shootings he deemed unjustified (which was good-ish). And some years passed. And on February 23, 2020, Ahmaud Arbery was ambushed and killed by a former police officer and his son in Glynn County, Georgia. On March 13, 2020 Breonna Taylor was killed by Louisville Metro Police officers serving a ‘no-knock warrant’ related to two individuals already in police custody. Kenneth Walker (Taylor’s partner at the time) fired upon the officers with a licensed and then called 911 to report the home invasion and shooting of his girlfriend. Kenneth was initially charged with first-degree assault and attempted murder of a police officer (charges were dropped in May 2020). George Floyd was killed on May 25, 2020 after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds (while Floyd was hand-cuffed and lying face down). Floyd was extra-judicially killed on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a local market. And some NYPD SUVs drove through a crowd on Saturday. And some Minnesota police officers screamed “Light ‘em up!” before firing on a woman and her family while they stood on their front porch in accordance with the curfew. “So as to how it’s going- it’s not great. Fred “p.s. That was heavy huh? Thanks for reading! I appreciate that many of you will seek to reach out, express solidarity, etc. And while that would be greatly appreciated, here are some things I’d appreciate even more: - Reaching out to and supporting diverse analysts and associates within the firm; a common bit of feedback from our junior colleagues is that while our firm expresses a commitment to equality and social justice up top, they don’t necessarily see commitment and support from their direct managers (the VPs and MDs they interact with more regularly). I’ll be okay; look after them. - Donate money to advocacy organizations (don’t want to violate firm policy here; MDs+ feel free to reach out for recommendations, happy to brainstorm with everyone else). Also worth noting that there are six times as many white Americans as black Americans (suspect even more skewed at GS). The more people we can get off the sidelines, the better. - Donate time to same (obviously we’re all busy, isolating, etc; I wish I were better about this myself. Same point as above applies) - Support minority-owned businesses. Policing is closely tied to class, just as socioeconomics are closely tied to race. Our society naturally defends vested economic interests, and while it won’t solve everything economic empowerment and sociopolitical empowerment are closely linked. And the inter-racial wealth gap is huge. “p.s.s. As always, happy to chat about anything discussed above; feedback welcome.

That represents a big cultural shift for an industry that has spent most of the past decade sweeping balance sheets clean of unpaid loans after coming under fire from supervisors for lending too freely. Ferraro, who declined to say how much he was seeking, said both banks he applied to had asked for his earnings statements for 2019 and 2018, which are not required under the government’s decree. His experience echoes those of other businesses struggling to survive as Italy’s economy sinks into its fourth recession in a decade, with an expected 8% contraction this year. Mara Bartolini, 42, the owner of a gift store in Cremona, in the northern Lombardy region which has borne the brunt of the outbreak, said her bank had told her it may take two to four weeks to get the fully-guaranteed loan. At the other end of Italy’s boot, Michele Mandala has also been told to wait a month for the money he needs because he does not expect to be able to reopen his cinema theatre in the Sicilian town of Caltanissetta until after the summer. LIQUIDITY TAP Bank officials say they simply cannot cope with the workload after being hit by debt moratorium requests, which the Bank of Italy says amount so far to 1.3 million for more than 140 billion euros in loans. The government fund that provides some of the guarantees on loans has advised banks to upload requests in bulk at nighttime, when online traffic slows. Banks must assess creditworthiness, as they bear part of the risk, yet the COVID-19 crisis makes it hard to gauge the ability of borrowers to repay their debt. Lenders say they face legal risk under Italian law because they can be held liable for credit abuse or aiding bankruptcy if a debtor defaults. “The problem is that only drops are coming out of the government’s liquidity tap,” said Roberto Sambuco, a partner at leading financial advisory firm Vitale&Co. Besides the 100% guarantee on the smaller loans, Italy provides a 90% guarantee on up to 800,000 euros, which can rise to 100% with co-insurance schemes. It guarantees between 70% and 90% of larger loans, depending on the size of the company. Sambuco said the government had to modify the package to make the process more direct, like it is in France, the United States or in Switzerland where loans of up to 500,000 Swiss francs ($514,000) are fully guaranteed. “The risk that tens of thousands of firms may just die of thirst is significant. The situation is much more serious than measures put in place by the government can remedy.” The ABI is, meanwhile, calling for a legal shield from prosecution at least for loans worth up to 100,000 euros. HOW TO REPAY? In a study by three of its economists, the Bank of Italy said direct state transfers, without an obligation for companies to pay them back, would be necessary. The U.S. government is offering loans that can be forgiven if most of the money is used for payroll costs. Italy has also said it plans to introduce them but its public finances, already stretched to the limit, leave little room for manoeuvre. Sambuco said Rome would need help from the European Union and not just from the European Central Bank. “Without the EU umbrella we don’t have the necessary resources,” he said. EU leaders agreed on Thursday to build a trillion-euro emergency fund to help the bloc recover from the pandemic but postponed any decision on divisive details until the summer. Their jockeying is a world away from Ferraro in Amelia who, like many other businesses, faces having to take on loans with little idea of how the economy will fare. “I’m venturing abroad, but those who are betting on Italy getting back on its feet, how are they going to repay all this debt two years from now if that recovery is nowhere to be seen?” $1 = 0.9215 eurosAdditional reporting by Giuseppe Fonte and Emilio Parodi;Editing by Pravin CharOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/File PhotoPARIS (Reuters) - French high-school school students will not sit the traditional ‘baccalaureat’ (bac) exam this summer due to the coronavirus, the education minister said on Friday, an unprecedented move that highlights the scale of disruption caused by the pandemic. It is the first time since its inception in 1808 under Napoleon Bonaparte that the ‘bac’ exam will not take place in its traditional form. Even the sweeping student and labour protests of May 1968 did not prevent the exam going ahead. Instead, students will receive an average score in each subject calculated from marks given for tests and homework throughout the year, Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer said in a televised address. “This is the most simple, secure and fair solution in these difficult times”, he said, adding that marks obtained during the current lockdown period would not be taken into account. France has confirmed nearly 60,000 cases of the coronavirus so far and as of Friday it had recorded 5,387 deaths, the fourth highest tally in the world. Schools and universities have been shut since early March to help halt the spread of the virus. Public end-of-year exams in some other countries including Britain have also been cancelled due to the pandemic. If conditions allow, France could ramp up classes in June to make up for lost time in the education of its young people, said Blanquer, who has previously raised the possibility of schools reopening in early May. In such a scenario, he added, the pupils’ attendance would be a factor in their obtaining the ‘bac’. On Friday he said a resumption of classes in early May was for now just a “hypothesis”.

British media reports have cited allegations from a number of ex-gymnasts describing abusive behaviour from coaches and staff. “We are deeply troubled to hear the comments made by some British athletes relating to culture and welfare issues within British Gymnastics,” the BAC said in a statement on Tuesday. “No athlete should be expected to tolerate an abuse of power or poor practice.  The performance environment should be a place of mutual trust and respect where athletes are supported in achieving their best.   “The BAC is worried to hear of athlete experiences which appear not to reflect these standards and would urge that any allegations are investigated thoroughly.”  The sport’s governing body, British Gymnastics, said it was encouraging any gymnasts, past or present, who has concerns to contact their Integrity Unit. “British Gymnastics condemns any behaviour which is harmful to the wellbeing of our gymnasts. Such behaviours are completely contrary to our standards of safe coaching. Our Positive Coaching Behaviours programme, which is mandatory for all coaches, sets out clearly why such behaviours are harmful and unacceptable. “Our Integrity Unit investigates all allegations reported to us or identified by our national network of club welfare officers and takes disciplinary action to prevent recurrence.” Reporting by Simon Evans, editing by Pritha SarkarOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

A 25-year-old worker of the EQC-SI unit of the Samsung Display factory in Bac Ninh province tested positive on Sunday, according to a statement released on Monday by the anti-COVID-19 task force of neighbouring Bac Giang province. Parent Samsung Electronics Co Ltd confirmed the case, but said Samsung Display’s production lines in Vietnam had not been affected. Nguyen Huong Giang, chair of the People’s Committee of Bac Ninh province, told state broadcaster VTV on Monday that 44 people at the unit had been quarantined, and that the factory and buses used to transport workers have been sprayed with disinfectant.  Samsung Electronics is the largest single foreign investor in the Southeast Asian country, and its shipments, mostly smartphones, account for around a quarter of Vietnam’s exports. Vietnam’s health ministry has reported 262 COVID-19 cases in the country, and no deaths.

With about 50,000 panels dedicated to some 100,000 people who have died from AIDS, the quilt is the world’s largest ongoing piece of community folk art and one of the most famous symbols of the AIDS pandemic, according to its custodians. “Sewing is how I chose to memorialise my friends I’ve lost to AIDS,” said Gert McMullin, who has been sewing as a volunteer since the giant tapestry was conceived by a gay rights activist in 1987, in a statement.  “I just can’t sit idly by during this new crisis.” The United States has recorded more fatalities from COVID-19, the severe respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, than any other country, with 24,000 deaths as of Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally. Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks are so severe in the United States that health workers treating contagious patients have appealed for help on social media under the hashtag #GetMePPE.      The quilt was set to go on display in San Francisco this month but the exhibition was postponed when coronavirus lockdown rules were put in place and volunteers decided to turn their skills to making masks instead. The washable masks are made from fabric that would have been used to sew new patches of the quilt together and will be used by clients and staff of Bay Area Community Services (BACS), a local non-profit that provides housing to homeless people. Some 400 masks have been sewn already, with volunteers vowing to sew hundreds more. “Sewing masks for BACS helps me have hope,” McMullin said. “It will make a difference.” Reporting by Oscar Lopez @oscarlopezgib; editing by Katy Migiro.

British Gymnastics had said last week that it had commissioned Jane Mulcahy QC to conduct the review. It said on Thursday, however, that it had now asked UK Sport and Sport England to co-commission it instead to “remove all doubt” of the review’s independence and integrity. A number of ex-gymnasts have come forward and described abusive behaviour from coaches and staff.  “It’s vital the review is unequivocally independent with full resources to effectively deal with concerns raised by gymnasts,” CEO of British Gymnastics Jane Allen said in a statement. “In the past week, the complexities have increased and it is clear to retain the trust of the gymnastics community we have decided to recuse ourselves from any management of the review. “Our priority is to learn the lessons and ensure the welfare of all those within gymnastics. By stepping aside, we hope the review can now proceed unimpeded.” UK Sport and Sport England said they welcomed British Gymnastics’ decision to step aside and agreed to co-commission the review. They said they were also working with the British Athletes Commission (BAC) and the Child Protection in Sport Unit (CPSU) to ensure the review has the “credibility and the confidence of those who have the courage to come forward”. “Our immediate priority is to provide support for all those affected by these allegations,” UK Sport said in a statement. “We are working with the BAC as it finalises its plans to assist gymnasts and others who have been impacted to raise their concerns and take part in the review.” Reporting by Rohith Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby DavisOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood speaks at the White House in Washington February 22, 2013. REUTERS/Larry DowningRay LaHood, the former U.S. Secretary of Transportation, will join a Washington, D.C-based advocacy group, where he will push for Congress to fund improvements in the nation’s roads, bridges, airports, rails and ports. Separately, David Strickland, who lead the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration until last month, will join a Washington law firm. Building America’s Future named LaHood as co-chairman, alongside billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who just ended three terms as mayor of New York City, and former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell. LaHood, 68, was President Barack Obama’s transportation chief from 2009 until July 2013, and is a former Republican congressman from Illinois. The group said it expects to draw on from LaHood’s expertise in advocating for transportation issues and reaching across the partisan aisles. Bloomberg cofounded Building America’s Future in 2008 with Rendell and then California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to push for improvements in the nation’s infrastructure. “We need Washington to step up and provide the necessary funding so cities can invest in stronger, more resilient infrastructure that is able to withstand future severe weather events,” Bloomberg said in a statement. BAF said it plans “aggressive advocacy” to bolster investment in transportation and infrastructure “While there is widespread agreement that our nation’s aging roads, bridges, transit and aviation systems are woefully inadequate, Washington has failed to show leadership in making the tough decisions to increase revenue to fund these critical investments,” LaHood said in a statement. LaHood’s appointment at BAF comes as the Highway Trust Fund, which pays for transportation and infrastructure projects with money received from a federal fuel tax, is expected to run out of money in coming months. BAF is pushing for Congress to keep the fund from insolvency. A long-time Washington insider, Strickland was named as a partner in the regulatory and legislative practices group at the law firm Venable LLP. Strickland, who oversaw the development of the first national fuel efficiency program and pushed for child passenger safety at the NHTSA, is a Harvard-educated lawyer who spent eight years as a staff member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Strickland joins a number of other former regulators and lawmakers at Venable, including Birch Bayh, previously a Senator from Indiana, and James Burnley IV transportation secretary during the Ronald Reagan administration.

"March 10, 2015",BAF,"                Fitch Affirms FAMSA's IDRs at 'B+'; Outlook Stable - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States IntelMarch 10, 2015 /  6:35 PM / 5 years agoFitch Affirms FAMSA's IDRs at 'B+'; Outlook Stable9 Min Read(The following statement was released by the rating agency) MONTERREY, March 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following ratings of  Grupo Famsa, S.A.B. de C.V. (FAMSA): --Foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'B+'; --Local currency IDR at 'B+'; --Long-term national scale rating at 'BBB(mex)'; --Short-term national scale rating at 'F3(mex)'; --USD250 million senior unsecured notes due in 2020 at 'B+/RR4'; --MXN1 billion Certificados Bursatiles issuance due 2016 at 'BBB(mex)'; --MXN1 billion short-term Certificados Bursatiles programs at 'F3(mex)'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. FAMSA's ratings reflect its market position in the Mexican retail sector,  geographic and product diversification, broadly stable operating cash flow  generation by the retail operation, as well as an expectation of a gradual  improvement in leverage. On the other hand, the ratings are constrained by  historically low growth in retail sales and a linkage with its banking  subsidiary, Banco Ahorro Famsa (Banco Famsa; or BAF), rated 'BBB(mex)'/Stable  Outlook). The 'RR4' rating reflects average recovery prospects in case of  default between 30% and 50% of principal. KEY RATING DRIVERS Stable Performance in Mexican Retail Sales: Recently, notwithstanding the weak consumer confidence and expenditure during  2014, Famsa showed basically stable revenues, with a 1.2% drop in consolidated  revenues in 2014. EBITDA margins fell 87 basis points, partly due to SG&A  increases. Going forward, the firm is trying to capitalize on 4Q'13's  acquisition of Montemex, to broaden not just its financial services offer, but  its geographic footprint within Mexico. Montemex's addition will help with some  cross-selling opportunities for merchandise through catalog and limited-variety  displays in Montemex's locations. FAMSA competes directly with larger Mexican  retail chains such as Coppel and Elektra, which also target the low-income  segment of the population. Banco Famsa Undergoing Operational Consolidation: FAMSA's financial division, Banco Famsa (about 45% of FAMSA's total assets), has  good brand equity and competitive position in consumer finance, mainly in  northeastern Mexico. Its financial performance is constrained by its high  loan-impairment charges; however, BAF is addressing it and still shows a  reasonable capital adequacy. In addition, BAF continues to operate with a lower  cost of funding from a diversified and growing base of customer deposits. BAF  also shows organic growth of its loan portfolio, although customers' sensitivity  to a weak economic environment continues to be a limiting factor.  Manageable Increase in NPLs: The increase in non-performing loans (NPLs) for Banco Famsa in 2014 was mostly  driven by loan accounting changes, and to a lesser degree, by the economic  environment and operational concerns. Starting July 2013, loans originated by  Promobien, a payroll lender which is also a subsidiary of FAMSA, were no longer  accounted for as part of the loan portfolio, but as collection rights. This  caused current loans to decrease far more than NPLs and thus resulted in an  increase in the NPL ratio. This ratio, as of December 2014 and including  collection rights, was 14.2%, lower than the 15.1% of a year before. Excluding  collection rights and as reported by the CNBV banking authority, the percentages  are 17.9% and 16.8% for 2014 and 2013. USA Operations EBITDA-Positive: Currently, fiscal year end (FYE) 2014 EBITDA for the U.S. operations is MXN88  million, an increase compared to MXN55 million in 2013. Furthermore, the U.S.  operation has seen its first same store sales increase in the last five years,  which can be attributed to stronger consumer confidence among U.S. consumers,  including the subsectors served by Famsa USA in Texas and Illinois. The company  is planning on growing the U.S. operation modestly, with just one store opening  in 2015. Leverage Expected to Gradually Decrease: Fitch expects debt-to-EBITDA (excluding bank deposits) to  steadily decline in  the short- to medium-term from current levels. Consolidated leverage has  increased due to bank capitalization efforts and to finance working capital.  Debt-to-EBITDA and net debt-to-EBITDA for 2014 (excluding bank deposits) are at  5x and 3.9x, respectively. Including bank deposits, these ratios are 14.5x and  13.4x for 2014. In December 2014, the company carried out a recapitalization for  MXN1.5 billion, of which MXN850 million was used for debt reduction. This  compensated for an increase in USD-denominated debt due to the Mexican peso's  devaluation against the U.S. dollar. Furthermore, FAMSA has not declared  dividends for the last few years and has a limited share repurchase program for  up to MXN300 million.  Liquidity Should Be Adequate: For year-end 2014, FAMSA's debt amounted to MXN7.8 billion and bank deposits  totaled MXN14.8 billion. FAMSA's debt is comprised of senior notes, national  short- and long-term issuances and bank loans. Short-term debt as of Dec. 31,  2014 was about MXN3.1 billion (pro forma short-term debt after January 2015's  commercial paper issuance of MXN2.7 billion), with non-restricted cash holdings  of about MXN1.7 billion, so some refinancing risk could persist. Pro forma  short-term debt is 93% denominated in pesos and it is mostly made up of  short-term Cebures programs and bank loans and is primarily used to finance  working capital. KEY ASSUMPTIONS: Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include: -- Consolidated debt (excluding bank deposits) to be around MXN8.5 billion in  the medium term. -- BAF to continue facing pressure on capital adequacy and operational metrics. -- If necessary, FAMSA will continue to support Banco Famsa. -- Consolidated EBITDAR to be around MXN2.5 billion in the medium term. -- EBITDA from the U.S. division to be neutral-to-positive. -- Non-restricted cash balance will be above MXN1 billion. RATING SENSITIVITIES: Credit quality could be negatively affected by deterioration in BAF's  creditworthiness beyond FAMSA's ability to lend support, by consolidated  leverage (excluding bank deposits) consistently above 5.5x, by lower EBITDA  generation by FAMSA USA that results in higher leverage levels, as well as by  deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio. Conversely, creditworthiness would benefit from increased EBITDA generation due  to improving margins and/or organic growth in sales that consistently  outperforms the industry, as well as from lower debt levels resulting from less  use of credit lines, factoring, and other short-term debt.

"January 18, 2017",BAF,"                Trump tax cuts could mean more Novartis investment in U.S. - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Big Story 15January 18, 2017 /  9:30 AM / 4 years agoTrump tax cuts could mean more Novartis investment in U.S.Ben Hirschler3 Min ReadDAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s plans to cut U.S. corporate tax rates could trigger increased investment in the United States by Novartis, its chief executive told Reuters, despite the president-elect’s recent harsh words on drug prices. FILE PHOTO: CEO Joe Jimenez of Swiss drugmaker Novartis addresses the annual news conference at the company's headquarters in Basel January 27, 2015.   REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo  “When we build a new manufacturing site we think about the tax rate, we think about the economy of the country, we think about jobs, so a booming U.S. economy would make the U.S. more attractive for investment,” Joe Jimenez said on Wednesday. Trump unnerved drug company executives last week by saying the industry was “getting away with murder” on pricing and promising to introduce more competition to drive down costs. Jimenez said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that he expected continued pressure on prices in the U.S. market but his company was already adapting by shifting to outcomes-based pricing.  The Swiss drugmaker recently struck deals with two U.S. insurers for its heart failure drug Entresto under which payments are calculated based on any proven reduction in patient admissions to hospital, not on the number of pills consumed. Entresto has got off to slow start but Jimenez said there had been a “nice pick up in prescriptions” more recently. It will update investors on prospects for the potential blockbuster when it reports full-year results next week, he added. Novartis is holding an R&D day to coincide with its results on Jan. 25, where it will highlight pipeline prospects. These include a novel cell therapy for childhood leukemia called CTL-019, which Jimenez confirmed was on track for submission to regulators for approval early this year. Another closely watched new drug is BAF-312 for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Novartis is discussing with U.S. and European regulators whether it could file BAF-312 for approval based on a single Phase III clinical trial, Jimenez said. Novartis is looking to these and other new products for heart and eye conditions to help offset generic competition to its old blood cancer drug Glivec. “We have a number of catalysts that are coming,” Jimenez said. “From the end of 2017 we will be completely out from under that genericisation and the company should enter its next growth phase beginning in 2018.” Novartis is currently weighing plans to sell its substantial stake in Basel-based rival Roche but Jimenez said he was in no rush, adding that recent weakness in European drug stocks relative to U.S. ones meant the timing wasn’t right just now. “Obviously, when we move on that stake it would be at a time when we want to ensure that Novartis shareholders get the benefit of the most value,” he said. Novartis built up its one-third stake in Roche voting stock between 2001 and 2003 under former Chairman Daniel Vasella for a possible merger that never happened.

REUTERS/Vivek Prakash/File Photo (Reuters) - Novartis (NOVN.S), lagging some other big drugmakers in the first wave of immunotherapy drugs that are revolutionizing cancer treatment, hopes to catch up by focusing on the next wave of immune system-boosting medicines. Setting out its research objectives in slides for a press conference on Wednesday, it said it aimed for “a leadership position in oncology” by focusing on second-generation immunotherapy. The Swiss drugmaker said it was rapidly progressing 18 checkpoint and other novel targets and expected to be running 20 exploratory studies in immuno-oncology by early 2017. Merck & Co (MRK.N), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) and Roche (ROG.S) are in the lead with cancer immunotherapies already on the market, but the field is developing fast and new treatments are expected to play an important role in drug cocktails. Novartis is already developing a novel cell therapy for childhood leukemia called CTL-019, which is on track for submission to regulators for approval early this year, although this initial market opportunity is small. Outside cancer, Novartis has a closely watched new drug for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis called BAF-312, which it hopes to file for approval in the first half of 2017, pending consultations with regulators.     It is also looking to new products for heart and eye conditions and other serious diseases to help offset generic competition to its old blood cancer drug Glivec.

REUTERS/Axel Schmidt - RC141F918360BERLIN (Reuters) - The Air Berlin AB1.DE pilots who performed an unusual maneuver on the airline’s last long-haul flight to Duesseldorf in October did not break any rules and will not be fined, the German air traffic regulatory agency said on Tuesday. The pilots of flight AB7001 from Miami with 223 passengers on board made a low pass over the airport after aborting a landing on Oct. 16, and videos of the move went viral on social media. One of the pilots told a TV broadcaster he wanted to make a farewell statement.  Pilots are trained in “go-around” procedures for aborted landings, but the left turn over the airport performed by the Air Berlin crew was unusual and so German aviation authorities investigated the incident. After examining radar data and voice recordings, the BAF federal regulatory agency for air traffic control determined that the pilots had asked for permission from the airport tower to carry out the left turn in plenty of time. “The BAF came to the conclusion that the relevant permissions had been given and from the point of view of the air traffic controllers, all the relevant safety conditions were met,” the federal regulatory agency said.    Air Berlin filed for insolvency in August after years of losses, carrying out its final flights in October.

The two top EU officials were to leave on their own plane, provided for them by Belgian Air Force (BAF), to go back to Brussels after a meeting of leaders of the world’s 20 biggest economies (G20) in the Turkish sea resort of Antalya. But they were told that due to security concerns about the plane they will have to wait for another aircraft to fetch them on Tuesday, the official said, possibly around noon. Turkish services were investigating, the official said. Other flights left Antalya on schedule, a Reuters reporter at the airport said.

"March 11, 2020",BAH,"                Witchcraft beliefs blamed for halting drive to end FGM in Guinea - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Big Story 10March 11, 2020 /  1:38 AM / 4 months agoWitchcraft beliefs blamed for halting drive to end FGM in GuineaEmma Batha3 Min ReadLONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Belief in witchcraft is hampering efforts to eradicate female genital mutilation (FGM) in Guinea where almost all girls are cut, campaigners said on Tuesday. Aminata Bah, who underwent FGM at the age of five, said many people in the West African country believed traditional circumcisers had supernatural powers and girls feared being cursed if they spoke about what had happened to them. With 97% of women cut, Guinea is estimated to have the second highest prevalence of FGM globally after Somalia.  Although most people are Muslim, belief in witchcraft is widespread, Bah told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at an event hosted by the National FGM Centre.  In some communities, she said the flesh removed from girls during the ritual was used for spells or in traditional medicines to cure illnesses and infertility. An anti-FGM charity in Nigeria, where a quarter of women have been cut, recently tweeted that some circumcisers sell clitorises to “fetish priests” who turn them into aphrodisiacs. Bah said FGM was surrounded by myths and girls were often told something bad, like infertility, would happen to them if they spoke about it. If a girl died during FGM it was frequently linked to witchcraft, she added. “It’s about putting fear into girls’ minds so they accept whatever happens to them,” Bah said.  “It’s hampering efforts (to end FGM). It’s definitely stopping people talking about it because they don’t want to get cursed.” She said witchcraft beliefs existed in Muslim and Christian communities in other West African countries affected by FGM, including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Senegal, Mali and Gambia. Worldwide an estimated 200 million girls have been cut, according to U.N. data, but beliefs around the practice vary. The ritual - often done in the name of culture or religion and believed to make girls pure - usually entails the partial or total removal of external genitalia. The vaginal opening may also be sewn up. Mama Sylla, who runs a charity in Britain called La Fraternite Guineenne to campaign against FGM, told how she nearly died after being cut at the age of nine. “It was extremely painful. I bled for three days. I was lucky to survive. They said a witch had put a curse on me,” she said, adding that FGM was a factor in Guinea’s high maternal mortality rate. “Many women die giving birth. People will say it’s because the baby was too big, but it’s because the mother cannot push because she’s been cut.” The question of whether FGM can have links to witchcraft arose during a landmark trial last year when a mother-of-two became the first person in Britain to be convicted of FGM. The Ugandan-born woman tried to halt police investigations with spells involving curses inserted in cows’ tongues and bitter fruit but an expert on FGM said the practice was not connected to witchcraft.

FILE PHOTO: Esports - Renault F1 Esports Facility Tour - Whiteways Technical Centre, Enstone, Britain - November 25, 2019. Jarno Opmeer, F1 Esports driver for Renault Sport Team smiles. Picture taken November 25, 2019. REUTERS/John SibleyThe first, run on the official F1 2019 PC video game, will be held from 2000GMT this Sunday — a day when fans should have been tuning in to watch the real life Bahrain Grand Prix. The virtual race will be over 28 laps, half the real distance. “Every subsequent race weekend will see the postponed real-world Formula One race replaced with a Virtual Grand Prix,” Formula One said in a statement. The Esports Virtual Grand Prix Series will run until May. Other cancelled or postponed races still to come include    Vietnam, China, the Netherlands, Spain and Monaco. “The first race of the series will see current F1 drivers line up on the grid alongside a host of stars to be announced in due course,” said Formula One, whose existing esports world championship starts later in the year. Participants will compete remotely with a broadcast available on Formula One’s YouTube, Twitch and Facebook channels. It is expected to run for 90 minutes, including qualifying. “Due to the wide variety of gaming skill levels amongst the drivers, game settings will be configured in such a way to encourage competitive and entertaining racing,” Formula One added. “This includes running equal car performance with fixed setups, reduced vehicle damage, and optional anti-lock brakes and traction control for those less familiar with the game.” EXHIBITION RACES Online exhibition races, allowing fans to go head-to-head with real F1 drivers, will be held on non-GP weekends. “We are very pleased to be able to bring some light relief in the form of the F1 Esports Virtual GP, in these unpredictable times, as we hope to entertain fans missing the regular sporting action,” said Julian Tan, Formula One’s head of Esports. “With every major sports league in the world unable to compete, it is a great time to highlight the benefits of esports and the incredible skill that’s on show.” Interest in online racing has exploded since real life motorsport activities were stalled by the virus and this weekend offers plenty of choice. “Super Sim Saturday” sees three virtual races in quick succession — the Nuerburgring Endurance Series, IMSA Super Sebring and THE RACE All-Stars Esports Battle. The All-Stars event, first organised at short notice by Torque Esports and http://www.the-race.com last Sunday when Australia was cancelled and featuring Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, has moved from Sunday to Saturday to avoid a clash with F1. Veloce Esports are running a ‘Not the Bah GP’ at 1800GMT on Sunday after an initial ‘Not the Aus GP’ with McLaren F1 driver Lando Norris last weekend. Golfer Ian Poulter said he will be in that field, along with Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. “I love cars, I love Formula One, I love everything about motorsport,” the Briton told Sky Sports television from his home in Florida, where he has a simulator in his garage. “It should be fun not just for me but viewerships around the world which are craving sports... we’d love to get back to normality in sport as soon as possible, but if we can do it in a different format it will be quite fun for everyone to see.”   Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Christian Radnedge and Ed OsmondOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

FILE PHOTO: A plate of roti prata is seen at a stall in eastern Singapore August 9, 2016. REUTERS/Edgar Su/File PhotoThe tiny island nation, known for its no-nonsense law enforcement and widespread surveillance, has one of the highest coronavirus caseloads in Asia due to mass outbreaks in cramped migrant worker dormitories.  But it has won international praise for its strict quarantine and contact tracing regime that have limited infections in the wider community. In mid-March, 22-year-old financial adviser Tay Chun Hsien was ordered not to leave his home after he was suspected of being a contact of a coronavirus patient, court documents show. But just 30 minutes before the order was due to expire he headed to a nearby food court where, according to local media, he ate roti prata, an Indian-inspired flatbread popular in Southeast Asia.  As he was eating, an officer monitoring his quarantine called his mobile phone to check if he was at home but Tay said he had left to buy food because he was hungry, according to the case records. “At this critical stage in the nation’s fight against COVID-19, everyone has a part to play. Persons who are subject to Home Quarantine Orders and other measures...must comply,” said deputy public prosecutor Norman Yew, adding that Tay had returned home quickly and presented low risk of transmission. Tay, who was fined S$1,500 ($1,063.00) this week, did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Under the Infectious Diseases Act, punishments for such breaches can be fines of up to S$10,000 or imprisonment of up to six months, or both.  Tougher punishment was doled out to Alan Tham Xiang Sheng, a  33-year-old businessman, who broke an order to stay home to eat bah kut teh - a pork rib soup common to Singapore and Malaysia.  Tham was given the order to stay home for 14 days in mid-March when he returned from Myanmar, one of a number of countries subject to travel restrictions at the time to curb imported infections.    The night he returned home, Tham went by bus to a local food court to eat the soup and posted pictures on social media, case records show. “Lives are at stake. A clear deterrent message must be sent to those who would put the health and safety of others at risk for the sake of their convenience or whims and fancies,” the public prosecutors said. Tham, who was sentenced to six weeks in jail, could not be reached for comment.

The 20-lap race on a virtual Indianapolis road course featured a cast of top drivers and gamers, competing remotely, after the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak brought motorsport to a standstill. Van Buren, a former simulator driver for McLaren who now performs the role for the Mahindra Formula E team, finished third in last weekend’s first All-Star race and this time won from third on the grid. McLaren Shadow esports racer Kevin Siggy was second with Portuguese gamer Nuno Pinto third. Spaniard Dani Juncadella, who races in the German Touring Car (DTM) championship, was the highest finishing real racer in fourth. Others who failed to make it through the heats to the 20-car final included former F1 racer Juan Pablo Montoya and Brazilian Tony Kanaan, both winners of the Indianapolis 500. Verstappen finished 11th last weekend in a race hastily put together by Torque Esports and www.the-race.com after Formula One’s season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne was cancelled. He had been due to return but the Dutch 22-year-old said instead that he would be racing on Monday in Team Redline’s ‘Real Racers Never Quit’ esports race, live on YouTube and Twitch. “So great to see so many of you are enjoying the sim racing we do online. I hope we can put on a show for all race fans to enjoy,” he said on Instagram. Formula One is also organising a virtual race on Sunday in the absence of the Bahrain Grand Prix, one of five rounds postponed due to the fast-spreading virus. Australia and the Monaco Grand Prix, a glamorous fixture on the calendar since 1955, have been cancelled entirely. Britain’s six-times Olympic cycling champion turned sportscar racer Chris Hoy will represent Red Bull in the F1 race, his first venture into esports, along with Austrian racing driver Philipp Eng. Former McLaren F1 driver and current Mercedes Formula E racer Stoffel Vandoorne will also feature. McLaren’s Lando Norris and Williams’s Canadian driver Nicholas Latifi are in a ‘Not the BAH GP’ at 1800GMT on Sunday organised by Veloce Esports that also features Real Madrid soccer goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and golfer Ian Poulter. Nico Hulkenberg, who left Formula One at the end of last year, has a busy weekend — the German competed in Saturday’s all-star event and will also appear in Sunday’s races.

The first seven rounds of the real championship have been cancelled or postponed, including the showcase Monaco Grand Prix, and it remains to be seen how many there will be ultimately. Bahrain would have been the second race of the year on Sunday and Liberty Media-owned Formula One had hoped to enlist current drivers in a virtual replacement using the Codemasters F1 2019 game. In the end McLaren’s Lando Norris and Williams’ Nicholas Latifi, who has yet to make his F1 race debut, were the only ones present. Others stepped up, however, with former McLaren F1 driver and current Mercedes Formula E racer Stoffel Vandoorne finishing second with Austrian Philipp Eng, who had started on pole position, third. English golfer Ian Poulter, ‘The Postman’ competing from the garage of his home in Florida, and Britain’s six times Olympic cycling gold medallist Chris Hoy also took part. So too did Nicolas Hamilton, brother of Britain’s six times world champion Lewis Hamilton, singer-songwriter Liam Payne and retired ex-F1 race winner Johnny Herbert. TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES Technical problems meant the race was reduced from half the real-life distance to 25% while Norris struggled with a poor connection that meant his car was controlled for much of the time by the computer, which he dubbed ‘Landobot’. Norris also made some cheeky calls seeking advice from other F1 drivers, including real life team mate Carlos Sainz and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, during the downtime. The McLaren driver had earlier raced in a separate ‘Not the BAH GP’ event organised by Veloce Esports and also featuring Poulter and Real Madrid’s Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. That event was divided into two separate races of 25% distance, both dominated by professional gamers. Former F1 driver Nico Hulkenberg, who left Renault at the end of last year, took part in all of the day’s action after also racing on Saturday in an All-Stars Esports Battle organised by Torque Esports. “Obviously in this current situation with the lack of activity, I thought I’d jump on the train and give it a try,” said the German. “Yesterday and earlier today I found it quite tough. There’s a lot of geeks on there that are really, really good. I’m just doing it for the love and the fun.” (Reporting by Alan Baldwin; Editing by Ken Ferris)Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The West African country introduced the ban in 2015 after a rise in rape, abuse and poverty during the deadly Ebola outbreak fueled a spike in teenage pregnancies. The government held that allowing pregnant girls to attend school would tire them out, expose them to ridicule and encourage other girls to get pregnant, while critics said the ban increased stigma and set thousands back in their studies. “The Ministry of Basic and Senior Secondary Education... hereby announces that the ‘ban on pregnant girls attending school’ is overturned with immediate effect,” the government said in a statement. “Overturning the ban is the first step in building a radically inclusive Sierra Leone where all children are able to live and learn in safety and dignity.” After years of advocacy proved unfruitful, human rights groups filed a case against Sierra Leone with West Africa’s top court in 2018. The court ruled in their favour in December, saying the ban was discriminatory and violated the right to equal education. “It’s been such a long fight,” said Sierra Leonean child rights activist Chernor Bah. “We didn’t need to have gone through this. I feel for those girls who were abandoned by this policy, who went through all of this and who, most of them, will never probably recover,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Education Minister David Sengeh said the state would replace the ban with two new policies focused on “radical inclusion” and “comprehensive safety” in the education system. Details were not yet announced, but the safety policy will include measures to protect girls from sexual violence in schools, said Judy Gitau, Africa coordinator of women’s rights group Equality Now, which worked with the government. “We did not anticipate that the response would be as positive as it is,” she said. Several other African countries also ban pregnant girls from attending school, including Tanzania and Equatorial Guinea. Activists urged their counterparts in other countries to keep fighting. “This victory shows the importance of collaboration between a variety of partners and not giving up,” said Sabrina Mahtani, a human rights lawyer who worked to lift the ban.

The Fusion (14-1) had a strong showing against the Outlaws (5-10), dominating the frontline battle through main tank Su-min “SADO” Kim. While Houston fought hard, with some moments of beating out Philadelphia’s star-studded lineup, it couldn’t keep up with the sheer mechanical skill coming from the Fusion and their deep bench. The Fusion took Lijiang Tower 2-1, Hollywood 3-2 and Volskaya Industries 3-2 to secure the win. The Outlaws drop from 13th to 14th with the loss. In other Sunday action, the Toronto Defiant (5-8) took a 3-0 series win against the Vancouver Titans (2-7). While the Defiant triumphed, led by flex support Young-seo “KariV” Bak, the Titans showed signs of continued growth since the May Melee tournament. Toronto took Ilios 2-1, Blizzard World 3-2 and closed out the series with a 3-2 win on Temple of Anubis. The Defiant rose from 16th to 13th with the win. Finally, the Los Angeles Valiant (7-6) took care of business with a 3-0 win over the Washington Justice (3-11). The Valiant’s young roster showed some lapses in concentration throughout the series, though it wouldn’t end up hurting L.A. in the long run. The Valiant played well around DPS Kai “KSP” Collins, rotating his DPS partner between Johannes “Shax” Nielsen and Kyle “KSF” Frandanisa. KSP and the crew shredded through the Justice, who are still working on integrating their newest acquisitions and entering a soft rebuild. The Valiant took Oasis 2-0, King’s Row 4-3 and full-held Volskaya Industries 2-0 to lock in a win. The Valiant rose from ninth to eighth with the win.

"May 4, 2020",BAK,"                'Like watching a train wreck': The coronavirus effect on North Dakota shale oilfields - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsMay 4, 2020 /  11:46 AM / 3 months ago'Like watching a train wreck': The coronavirus effect on North Dakota shale oilfieldsDevika  Krishna Kumar, Laila Kearney8 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil executive Bill Kent was with fellow managers in the Colorado board room of Resource Energy headquarters on April 20 when benchmark U.S. crude prices collapsed to minus $37 a barrel. Sitting six feet apart because of the coronavirus, they knew the pandemic was not only a personal matter.  FILE PHOTO: An oil pumpjack operates near Williston, North Dakota January 23, 2015.  REUTERS/Andrew CullenIt was also a business concern. “As we were sitting around the board room watching what was happening with prices, it was like watching a train wreck,” said Kent, vice president of engineering and operations at Resource Energy, backed by private equity giant Apollo Global Management. With businesses locked down and billions of people staying at home, demand for oil to fuel cars, planes and industry has dropped around 30% worldwide. The resulting supply glut has pushed U.S. crude prices well below production costs, forcing companies to start winding down operations. Producers are shutting down the higher-cost output first - and those are also the operations likely to stay shut the longest.      The Resource Energy team’s discussion turned to the remote Bakken shale region in North Dakota where the company, a relatively small producer, operates. Costs of extracting are some of the highest in the United States. So are the costs of transporting due to limited storage and the distance to refineries and consuming centers. Oil producers in the Bakken, which sprawls across North Dakota and eastern Montana, on average break even at $46.54 a barrel, according to an analysis by Deutsche Bank. That is well above the around $40 a barrel in the Permian basin, the largest U.S. shale field.  Bakken crude BAK- fetched $3.40 a barrel on April 21. It has since recovered to about $14, still below the cost of producing. The team at Resource Energy realized they would need to consider shutting down the remaining 20 percent of output still operating in the Bakken shale region, Kent said. North Dakota, second only to Texas in oil output among U.S. states, was taking a big hit. In just one day in late April, some 60,000 bpd were shut in the state. Output has dropped by at least 400,000 bpd since March 1, nearly a third of the state’s around 1.4 million bpd output before the crisis. State officials expect the volume shut in to rise further. “This is truly unprecedented,” said Lynn Helms, director of North Dakota’s Department of Mineral Resources, the state regulator overseeing oil production. In the days following the price collapse, oil companies sent teams out to shut wells.  Field inspectors, who work with the state’s 20 largest operators, had dire news for Helms, the worst of it from Continental Resources (CLR.N), the state’s largest operator. By April 21, about 95 percent of Continental’s production in the state had shut down. Continental on average produced about 188,000 boepd in North Dakota Bakken during fourth quarter 2019, with about 1,540 net producing wells as of year end, according to company data. Other large producers in the state were also shutting down. Oasis Petroleum (OAS.O) was halting all drilling in the Bakken, where it pumped about 80,000 boepd at the end of 2019. Hess Corp said it expected to halt drilling on five of its six rigs in the Bakken by the end of May. A week before Hess disclosed the reduction publicly on March 17, shale pioneer John Hess called U.S. Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota to inform him of the cuts. “I was in the Marble Room just off the Senate floor and he was very blunt ... The gravity of what was happening was really clear in his voice and his demeanor,” Cramer told Reuters.  This downturn stands out from previous ones and could affect debt-laden drillers in North Dakota more then those in other states, he said. “This time it seems worse than ever because it’s such a dramatic drop in such a fast time.” Whiting, once the largest oil producer in North Dakota, has declared bankruptcy while smaller producers that operate in the Bakken such as Bruin E&P Partners, backed by private equity firm ArcLight Capital, have hired restructuring advisers, sources said. Whiting and Bruin did not respond to requests for comment. Oilfield services company Canary, LLC, which has operations in the Bakken region, has had to furlough more than half of its workers since the oil downturn, Chief Executive Officer Dan Eberhart said. “That’s a tough call when you know those layoffs are going to ripple through the local community and affect everyone,” Eberhart said. “All we can do is keep as many people on payroll as possible and ride out the storm.”     GRAPHIC:  In North Dakota, shale oil producers slam brakes - here ‘ECONOMIC WASTE’ Independent producers in numerous states, including North Dakota, are pressing regulators to declare their production “economic waste.” That would allow producers to close wells without violating lease agreements. Two days after the price crash, Oklahoma’s energy regulator issued an order saying some production in the state could be deemed economic waste. Resource Energy, which pumped about 5,000 bpd before shutdowns, had held off closing the remaining producing fifth of its wells on leased land where the company is required to keep pumping oil or lose its leases.  The company is now waiting for a North Dakota regulators’ ruling that would allow it to shut-in those wells and still maintain leases, Kent said.  North Dakota’s Industrial Commission said it would consider whether to declare certain output uneconomic, thus freeing companies of their lease obligations, but not until a meeting in late May.  Several producers interviewed by Reuters said they were considering the legality of declaring “force majeure,” a clause usually reserved for wars, natural disasters or accidents that prevent a company from fulfilling contracts for reasons beyond its control. Continental became the first to do this last month, surprising shippers and refiners. Helms said total production curtailed came to 405,000 bpd as of April 24, when the latest data was made available, up from 295,000 bpd reported three days earlier. Producers shut 6,200 of the state’s 16,000 wells, up from 5,000 over the same period. Operators have stopped working with half the rigs that were in the state in late March, according to energy information provider Enverus. Oil producers and the service industries that depend on them are both cutting jobs. For a state like North Dakota, where oil and gas is a top industry, the downturn affects all aspects of life. “It affects everything. It affects all your stores, it affects your trucking companies, it affects every kind of service company you can think of ... you know just pretty much everything you can think of,” U.S. Senator John Hoeven of North Dakota told Reuters. Frederick Lawrence, vice president of economics and international affairs at the Independent Petroleum Association of America, said at least 2,200 jobs already had been lost in the state, and he expected thousands more could go.      “It started as just a temporary downswing but it’s the downswing that never really stopped,” said oilfield services worker Nils MacArthur. He is thinking of leaving the industry after more than 20 years in oil. “I don’t really have control over this anymore,” he said. “If this is an act of God, maybe I need to find another career because I guess God’s had enough of the oilfield.” Reporting by Devika Krishna Kumar and Laila Kearney; Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner, David French, Jennifer Hiller and Liz Hampton; Editing by David Gaffen, Simon Webb and Howard GollerOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

"May 14, 2020",BAK,"                Global oil refining could rebound in June, but margins weak: IEA - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsMay 14, 2020 /  2:03 PM / 2 months agoGlobal oil refining could rebound in June, but margins weak: IEAAhmad Ghaddar, Laura Sanicola, Devika  Krishna Kumar5 Min ReadLONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global oil refining production could start rebounding in June, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday, but refiners’ margins may be squeezed due to rising crude prices as producers slashed output much faster than expected. FILE PHOTO: A general view shows the French oil giant Total Refinery in Donges, France, December 20, 2019. REUTERS/Stephane Mahe/File PhotoRefiners throttled back output globally as the coronavirus pandemic sent billions of people into lockdown and cut fuel demand by 30%. Crude prices crashed, prompting the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, agreed to cut oil output by 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd), while other nations have also reduced output. “If crude supply adjusts more quickly to the oversupply than forecast, this will support crude prices and depress refinery margins, resulting in lower refining throughput than anticipated,” the IEA said in its monthly oil market report.      In recent days, several OPEC nations including Saudi Arabia said they will cut output more than originally pledged. Producers in the United States and Canada have cut production by 1.7 million bpd, much faster than expected.  The tight supply has hit refining margins in the United States and Europe. U.S. diesel margins HOc1-CLc1 are currently less than $11 a barrel, lowest seasonally over the last decade, while European diesel margins LGOc1-LCOc1 are below $5 a barrel, lowest since mid-2009. While the easing of some lockdown restrictions should boost fuel demand, refiners still face big headwinds and more are shutting down until margins improve.  Oil demand in April slumped by around 25%, or more than 25 million bpd, IEA monthly figures showed, in reaction to global lockdowns. In the United States, refining capacity use fell to 68% in the most recent week, just off an all-time low, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. But producer cuts have been swifter. Saudi Arabia said it will reduce output by nearly 5 million bpd in June, or 1 million bpd more than expected. Kuwait and United Arab Emirates also said they would clip production, boosting crude prices. “Crude market strength is exerting more and more pressure on refining economics, with our assessed global weighted average margin having fallen solidly into negative territory for the first time since Q2-2014,” JBC Energy said.  Fuel demand has rebounded modestly, sending refiners searching for supply, and that has boosted prices of key crude benchmarks that fell to historic lows in April.  “My phone has been blowing up in the last 10 days with refiners really scrambling to get more volumes, both short-term and long-term, because these shut-ins have impacted purchasers a lot quicker than they thought,” said John Zanner, senior strategist at Uplift Energy Strategy which works with producers to market barrels. Shut-ins by producers in North Dakota’s Bakken shale basin have been among the quickest in the country. Bakken crude at the Clearbrook, Minnesota, hub, has firmed to trade at about $2 a barrel above benchmark futures for June WTC-BAK, highest since late 2017, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Canadian crude differentials have strengthened to near an 11-year high, while crude in Midland, Texas, WTC-WTM is now trading at a premium to U.S. crude futures after sinking to deep discounts in April. Refiners across the globe have curbed output in recent months, but until recently they had some incentive to continue running. The IEA now sees global crude refining throughput at 66.2 million barrels-per-day, unchanged from April, and more than 14 million bpd lower from a year ago. If demand recovers more quickly than anticipated, it could boost margins, IEA said.

FILE PHOTO: Police vehicles idle on the outskirts of the opposition camp against the Dakota Access oil pipeline near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, U.S., February 8, 2017. REUTERS/Terray Sylvester/File PhotoThe decision by U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia followed the cancellation of another high-profile U.S. pipeline project on Sunday and came as a blow to the Trump administration’s efforts to lift the domestic fossil fuels industry by rolling back environmental red tape. According to the ruling, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) when it granted an easement to Energy Transfer LP (ET.N) to construct and operate a segment of the oil pipeline beneath Lake Oahe in South Dakota, because they failed to produce an adequate Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  The court ordered Energy Transfer to shut and empty the 570,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) line within 30 days, closing off the biggest artery transporting crude oil out of North Dakota’s Bakken shale basin to Midwest and Gulf Coast regions.  “Given the seriousness of the Corps’ NEPA error, the impossibility of a simple fix, the fact that Dakota Access did assume much of its economic risk knowingly, and the potential harm each day the pipeline operates, the Court is forced to conclude that the flow of oil must cease,” it said. It is rare for regulators or officials to force an oil pipeline to be drained, unless it is in the aftermath of a spill, oil market sources said. Energy Transfer said it was looking at legal and administrative measures to avoid a shutdown, and was considering an appeal if those efforts fail. In a filing seeking a temporary stay to the order, the company argued that time-consuming and expensive steps are required to shut the pipeline down safely and empty it of oil, which means the process would take well more than 30 days. If the motion for a stay pending an appeal is denied by the district court, the company said it intends to file one in the Washington, D.C., circuit court. Preparing a thorough EIS could take about thirteen months, according to an estimate by the Army Corp.  Consultancy Rapidan Energy Group said the ruling casts long-term doubts over the future of the pipeline, which has only been operating for about three years.  “With odds of a temporary stay on appeal only 30%, the court-ordered DAPL shutdown on Aug. 5 should last at least 10-12 months if Donald Trump wins re-election and permanently if not,” it said in a note. The ruling comes a day after Dominion Energy Inc (D.N) and Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N) decided to abandon the $8 billion Atlantic Coast Pipeline, meant to move West Virginia natural gas to East Coast markets, after a long delay to clear legal roadblocks almost doubled its estimated cost.

Native American and environmental groups cheered the DAPL court ruling. “Today is a historic day for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the many people who have supported us in the fight against the pipeline,” said Chairman Mike Faith of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which led protests and legal efforts against the project. “This pipeline should have never been built here. We told them that from the beginning.” Greenpeace USA Climate Director Janet Redman called the pipeline setbacks a victory in the fight against climate change. IMPACT The Trump administration, Republican lawmakers and industry groups blamed activists and said the pipeline setbacks would cost the U.S. economy. “I’m not quite sure what they’re cheering except for perhaps the loss of jobs all throughout America,” U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said during an interview on Fox Business Network. “Shutting down the Dakota Access Pipeline would have devastating consequences to North Dakota and to America’s energy security. This terrible ruling should be promptly appealed,” said Kevin Cramer, North Dakota Senator and Trump ally. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s campaign declined to comment. The American Petroleum Institute, the nation’s main oil and gas industry lobby group, called for urgent reform of the permitting system. The Association of Oil Pipe Lines (AOPL) said that if this decision is not reversed on appeal, Americans will be deprived of affordable energy. Energy Transfer shares dropped on Monday by about 8%. Large investors in the pipeline could also be on the hook for hundreds of millions in payments, according to a Reuters review of company disclosures. Slideshow (4 Images)Refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N), an investor in the project, said shutting down the pipeline would throw the country’s crude supply system out of balance and jeopardize national security.Oil prices LCOc1 CLc1 have plunged this year as the coronavirus pandemic eroded global demand by nearly 30% in April and restricted travel across the world.     The collapse forced oil producers across the United States to shut in production and curtail new drilling. North Dakota is one of the costliest spots in the United States to produce crude, and its output has dropped by about one-third from last year, more than most other oil-producing states. Bakken crude prices in Clearbrook, Minnesota WTC-BAK, slumped to their weakest since early May on news of the shutdown order, traders said. Market sources in the Bakken said the ruling will likely divert some oil flows onto railcars.

But the recovery in benchmark oil prices to around $40 a barrel makes some shale output profitable again, even though that level is unlikely to spur additional new drilling activity. Larger producers are re-opening the taps in low-cost plays in Texas, but also in expensive shale basins in North Dakota and Oklahoma. “With prices where they are now, if they stay above $30, I wouldn’t expect any significant curtailments from us in Q3 or beyond,” Devon Energy Corp Chief Executive David Hager said at a J.P. Morgan energy conference on Tuesday.  Fracking activity tracker Primary Vision estimates as much as 500,000 bpd of production will return to the market by month-end, while Rystad Energy estimates 400,000 bpd could be added to the market between June and August.  “Some of the bigger guys that we work with are starting to turn everything back on,” said Joshua Wade, an oil marketer in Oklahoma, who works with producers to transport barrels and buys lease volumes. (GRAPHIC - Shale producers pump barrels back into oil market: here)  Producers are also pumping oil out of storage, which filled when demand plummeted as billions of people worldwide stopped traveling due to lockdowns to slow the spread of coronavirus.  Weekly oil data shows U.S. output at about 10.5 million bpd, its lowest since March 2018 and off the all-time monthly record of about 12.9 million bpd reached in November, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Much of the declines came from shale wells that were choked back but not shut-in completely, several shale company executives said.  “We were able to shut in thousands of wells with really minimal time and effort. And we can bring those back on with really minimal time and effort, too,” EOG Resources Inc Chief Operating Officer Lloyd Helms said at a Tuesday industry conference. Diamondback Energy Inc focused on curtailing volumes rather than fully shutting wells, Adam Lawlis, vice president of investor relations, said in a statement.  About 8,000 bpd of the 10,000 bpd of oil that shale producer Devon curtailed came from choking back wells or slightly delaying wells.  “We’re in the process of bringing all of that back on,” Hager said.  Prices in cash markets reflect anticipated new supply. Crude oil for July delivery out of Midland, Texas, the heart of the Permian basin, sank to a discount to benchmark futures while Bakken prices fell to their weakest levels in a month last week. As of Friday in North Dakota, where the Bakken is primarily located, about 60,000 bpd of production had come back online from mid-May, leaving 450,000 still shut, according to the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources. Companies including private-equity backed Lime Rock Resources have turned wells in the Bakken back on while Continental Resources told pumpers to be ready to ramp up activity by July 1, sources familiar with the matter said.  Neither company responded to requests for comment.     ConocoPhillips is thinking of bringing back curtailed volumes over the next few months after shutting in a third of its production, CEO Ryan Lance told research firm IHS Markit. The company will also restore 100,000 bpd in shut-ins in Alaska by July. The increase in production may not last, analysts said. North American oil companies have slashed spending by 35%, and U.S. rig counts have dropped to a record low. Since shale well output declines by more than 60% after the first year, the reduced spend on drilling will weigh on shale production over the long term, sources at shale companies said.  Slideshow (2 Images)Producers also cautioned that rolling coronavirus outbreaks currently occurring in the United States may continue to restrict fuel demand.  One Bakken producer said they are operating at just 15% of usual output, and oil prices would need to hit $43 a barrel for output to fully resume.  “Oil going to $40 for a fleeting moment isn’t going to be enough for some of our stronger operators to say, ‘Okay, I’m going to just turn the turn the tap on.’ They need to see it be sustainable,” Nicholas O’Grady, CEO of Northern Oil and Gas said.

"May 15, 2020",BAK,"                UPDATE 2-Global oil refining could rebound in June, but margins weak -IEA - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Credit RSSMay 15, 2020 /  4:34 AM / 2 months agoUPDATE 2-Global oil refining could rebound in June, but margins weak -IEAAhmad Ghaddar, Laura Sanicola, Devika  Krishna Kumar6 Min Read(Adds Asia refinery run cuts, Singapore gasoil margins) By Ahmad Ghaddar, Laura Sanicola and Devika  Krishna Kumar LONDON/NEW YORK/SINGAPORE, May 15 (Reuters) - Global oil refining production could start rebounding in June, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday, but refiners’ margins may be squeezed due to rising crude prices as producers slashed output much faster than expected. Refiners throttled back output globally as the coronavirus pandemic sent billions of people into lockdown and cut fuel demand by 30%. Crude prices crashed, prompting the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, agreed to cut oil output by 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd), while other nations have also reduced output. “If crude supply adjusts more quickly to the oversupply than forecast, this will support crude prices and depress refinery margins, resulting in lower refining throughput than anticipated,” the IEA said in its monthly oil market report. In recent days, several OPEC nations including Saudi Arabia said they will cut output more than originally pledged. Producers in the United States and Canada have cut production by 1.7 million bpd, much faster than expected. The tight supply has hit refining margins in the United States and Europe. U.S. diesel margins HOc1-CLc1 are currently less than $11 a barrel, lowest seasonally over the last decade, while European diesel margins LGOc1-LCOc1 are below $5 a barrel, lowest since mid-2009. In Asia, gasoil margins, which are derived from Dubai crude prices, have slumped by around 60% in the past month to under $4 per barrel. The margins for the benchmark 10ppm gasoil grade in Singapore are currently at their lowest seasonal levels on record, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. While the easing of some lockdown restrictions should boost fuel demand, refiners still face big headwinds and more are shutting down until margins improve. Oil demand in April slumped by around 25%, or more than 25 million bpd, IEA monthly figures showed, in reaction to global lockdowns. In the United States, refining capacity use fell to 68% in the most recent week, just off an all-time low, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. But producer cuts have been swifter. Saudi Arabia said it will reduce output by nearly 5 million bpd in June, or 1 million bpd more than expected. Kuwait and United Arab Emirates also said they would clip production, boosting crude prices. “Crude market strength is exerting more and more pressure on refining economics, with our assessed global weighted average margin having fallen solidly into negative territory for the first time since Q2-2014,” JBC Energy said. Fuel demand has rebounded modestly, sending refiners searching for supply, and that has boosted prices of key crude benchmarks that fell to historic lows in April. “My phone has been blowing up in the last 10 days with refiners really scrambling to get more volumes, both short-term and long-term, because these shut-ins have impacted purchasers a lot quicker than they thought,” said John Zanner, senior strategist at Uplift Energy Strategy which works with producers to market barrels. Shut-ins by producers in North Dakota’s Bakken shale basin have been among the quickest in the country. Bakken crude at the Clearbrook, Minnesota, hub, has firmed to trade at about $2 a barrel above benchmark futures for June WTC-BAK, highest since late 2017, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Canadian crude differentials have strengthened to near an 11-year high, while crude in Midland, Texas, WTC-WTM is now trading at a premium to U.S. crude futures after sinking to deep discounts in April. Refiners across the globe have curbed output in recent months, but until recently they had some incentive to continue running. The IEA now sees global crude refining throughput at 66.2 million barrels-per-day, unchanged from April, and more than 14 million bpd lower from a year ago. If demand recovers more quickly than anticipated, it could boost margins, IEA said. Diesel margins in Europe traded in double digits throughout April but have since slumped, and refiners in Europe are already feeling the pain. Asian gasoil margins have not traded at double digits since March, and are currently around $10 per barrel below their 2019 average. Spain’s Petronor is the latest to announce economic run cuts, saying it had shut one of its crude units from May 9 at its 220,000 bpd Bilbao oil refinery due to slow demand and storage saturation. Japan’s biggest refiner, JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy Corp, shut a crude distillation unit at its Kawasaki refinery last month, while Taiwan’s Formosa Petrochemical Corp delayed the restart of some refinery units after maintenance and planned to process crude at 80% of capacity in May. Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corp also said last week it would shut its 110,000-barrel-per-day Tabangao refinery in the Philippines for one month from mid-May in response to the coronavirus-led decline in demand. A middle distillate trader said they already see tightening high-sulphur gasoil in the Mediterranean region, and offers of jet fuel were falling. “These are signs of run cuts,” he said.

FILE PHOTO: A pump jack on a lease owned by Parsley Energy operates in the Permian Basin near Midland, Texas U.S. August 23, 2018. Picture taken August 23, 2018.  REUTERS/Nick Oxford/File PhotoRefinery runs in Europe and China have been cut to allow time to sell off supplies of refined products before processing stored crude which is also stored in abundance, making the purchase of new oil shipments less attractive. Meanwhile, refining profits for products have improved slightly but are still near their depths during the worst of the pandemic, as the world faces an uncertain recovery. “Margins are not at the bottoms but they’re very bad - that’s not going to help demand. We see these potential spikes in COVID-19, which are also not going to help matters,” one oil trader said. “The market was overdone and is going to need to retrace to reflect the realities now.” The price slowdown is visible globally: offers for heavier Angolan Dalia crude and Congolese Djeno are down at least a $1 from just a week earlier to around a $1 above dated Brent. Spot discounts for Abu Dhabi’s light sour Murban grade have widened nearly a dollar compared to their official selling price in just a few days. Mediterranean crudes have also come off peaks: offers for CPC Blend have fallen by almost a dollar and Azeri crude is selling for a dollar less than earlier in June. Graphic: Physical oil differentials, here “We haven’t bought anything in the last several weeks as everything is so expensive. CPC is still the most affordable, but still 20-30 cents away from profitability,” a refiner said. “Many Mediterranean refiners have cut runs, so hopefully weaker demand may push differentials down.” In the United States, shale producers are now bringing back about a quarter of the volumes they shut as prices have improved, weighing on physical prices in the Permian and Bakken basins.  Much of the uptick in demand for physical crude deliveries came from China, but market sources say independent refiners there have shied away from the higher prices, cutting runs as they await new quotas from the government for crude imports.

The headquarter of UBI bank is seen in Brescia, Italy, March 9, 2016.   REUTERS/Alessandro BianchiItaly’s fifth-largest bank is seen playing a leading role in a new round of M&A between second-tier lenders grappling with negative rates, a stagnating economy and a digital revolution in the industry. UBI had been planning to reorganize its insurance operations, valued at 1 billion euros, under a three-year program it will unveil next month and had been looking for a new partner. But the sources said it would likely opt for a short-term extension of its bancassurance joint-venture with Cattolica (CASS.MI), which expires in December. It could also extend a life insurance joint-venture with Britain’s Aviva (AV.L) beyond December, they added   Aviva and Cattolica, Italy’s fifth-biggest insurer whose top investor is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), declined to comment. Asked about the possible extension of the Cattolica partnership on the sidelines of an event on Tuesday, UBI CEO Victor Massiah said multiple discussions were ongoing and the bank would inform the market in due course. Italian lenders are increasingly betting on insurance to buttress weakening banking revenues. Following Intesa Sanpaolo’s (ISP.MI) lead, UBI had also mulled bringing in-house its insurance business, which accounted for 15% of net profit between January and September and comprises of the stakes in the two joint-ventures as well as small insurer BAP Assicurazioni. Bancassurance deals — which allow an insurance company to sell its products to a bank’s clients — could also play a role in potential tie-ups, which are expected to involve UBI and rivals Banco BPM (BAMI.MI) and BPER Banca (BAMI.MI) as well as state-owned Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI). Large scale bad loan disposals, a more stable political environment and limited room for further cost cuts are set to make consolidation among Italian banks easier, according to Goldman Sachs.   “I believe UBI could start thinking about M&A in 2020”, Giandomenico Genta, chairman of UBI’s top investor Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Cuneo (CRC), told Reuters. With its 6% stake, CRC leads a consultation pact among shareholders holding in aggregate 18% of UBI. Shareholder support could smooth the path for a tie-up between UBI and BPER, whose insurance partner UnipolSai (US.MI) is also its top investor with a 20% stake, one banker said. “They’re the best fit,” broker Equita said, noting that BPER and UBI could sell part of their insurance, asset management or debt collection businesses to cover the restructuring costs of any merger.   Genta said the deciding factors for a tie-up would be the size of a capital increase that regulators would likely require and how many branches may need closing due to overlapping business.  Goldman Sachs recently flagged UBI’s “strong position” as a consolidator, saying it had a better risk profile than its peers. UBI is widely regarded as the best candidate to take on Monte dei Paschi, which the state must re-privatize by the end of next year.  Genta said BPER would a good option as would Monte dei Paschi after a planned bad loan clean-up, while a business overlap and a cash call estimated by analysts at 2 billion euros made Banco BPM a less palatable choice.

REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo           MILAN (Reuters) - Italy’s insurance authority has cleared Intesa Sanpaolo’s (ISP.MI) proposed bid for rival UBI Banca (UBI.MI), paving the way for market watchdog Consob to clear the prospectus for the deal as a crucial antitrust meeting nears. Intesa said in a statement on Wednesday, insurance authority IVASS had given it the go-ahead to gain control of UBI’s small in-house insurer BAP and acquire significant holdings in Aviva Vita and Lombarda Vita, two joint-ventures UBI has in place with Britain’s Aviva (AV.L) and Cattolica Assicurazioni (CASS.MI).  Consob now has five days to clear the publication of the prospectus for the multi-billion euro all-paper offer Intesa unveiled in February to create the euro zone’s seventh-biggest banking group. Italy’s antitrust authority, which still has to rule on the deal, has scheduled a final hearing on the case for Thursday after expressing concerns the tie-up would strengthen Intesa’s dominance in several areas. Intesa on Monday submitted stepped-up competition remedies, increasing the number of branches and assets it plans to sell to rival BPER Banca (EMII.MI) if the bid goes through in the hope of winning clearance. An antitrust verdict is not expected until late July, complicating matters for Intesa which had initially planned to launch its bid at the end of June before the summer holiday period, by which time it had expected to have cleared all regulatory hurdles. Publication of the prospectus is normally followed by the launch of the offer, but Intesa is still weighing options and indications it will receive at Thursday’s hearing will be important for any decision, a person familiar with the process said. The European Central Bank, the Bank of Italy and Luxembourg’s financial services authority all gave the deal a green light earlier this month.

Italy’s fifth largest bank is looking to sell roughly 60-70% of the unit which focuses on life insurance and includes stakes in a series of joint venture platforms with the likes of British insurer Aviva (AV.L), the sources said. UBI has hired KPMG to auction off the assets and wants to receive binding bids toward the end of September, one of the sources said. The deal is expected to value the entire business at about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), the sources said. UBI and Cattolica declined to comment while CNP Assurances was not immediately available for comment. UBI boss Victor Massiah said last week that the bank would unveil a reorganization of its insurance operations in conjunction with its new business plan which is due by the end of the year. UBI holds a 40% stake in a strategic partnership with Italian insurer Cattolica, known as Lombarda Vita, and has full control of BAP Assicurazioni. Additionally it has a 20% stake in a joint venture with Aviva, known as Aviva Vita. The Italian bank is in the process of bundling the assets under a holding company and could raise between 600 and 800 million euros by selling a majority stake in the division, the sources said. The sale initially drew interest from several European rivals including Italy’s financial services firm Unipol (UNPI.MI) which later decided against bidding, the sources said. Based in Verona, Cattolica Assicurazioni focuses on bancassurance products and is hoping to take control of its existing life insurance partnership with UBI as well as the other assets for sale, the sources said. The 123-year old company has hired UBS and Nomura to handle the talks, the sources said. French insurer CNP Assurances already partners with Italian bank UniCredit (CRDI.MI) but made international expansion a priority after selling a majority stake to French state-owned mail operator Banque Postale [LAPSTE.UL].

The BAP acknowledged that bankruptcy and district courts across the country have split on that question, but concluded that treating the guaranty as a discharged contingent liability is more consistent with the Bankruptcy Act’s broad definitions of “claims” and “debts” and its purpose of giving the debtor a fresh start.

Shareholder support could smooth the path for a tie-up between UBI and BPER, whose insurance partner UnipolSai is also its top investor with a 20% stake, one banker said. “They’re the best fit,” broker Equita said, noting that BPER and UBI could sell part of their insurance, asset management or debt collection businesses to cover the restructuring costs of any merger. Genta said the deciding factors for a tie-up would be the size of a capital increase that regulators would likely require and how many branches may need closing due to overlapping business. Goldman Sachs recently flagged UBI’s “strong position” as a consolidator, saying it had a better risk profile than its peers. UBI is widely regarded as the best candidate to take on Monte dei Paschi, which the state must re-privatise by the end of next year. Genta said BPER would a good option as would Monte dei Paschi after a planned bad loan clean-up, while a business overlap and a cash call estimated by analysts at 2 billion euros made Banco BPM a less palatable choice.

FILE PHOTO: A man walks in front of an office of First Investment Bank (Fibank) in Sofia, Bulgaria, June 12, 2020. REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov/File PhotoFibank’s capital increase is the last box Bulgaria has to tick before getting the nod to enter the European Union (EU) banking union and the ERM-2 mechanism, a two-year obligatory precursor to the euro zone. Sofia hopes to join both this year. State-owned Bulgarian Development Bank has acquired a 18.35% stake in the bank, and Valea Foundation, owned by Czech billionaire Karel Komarek, will hold 7.87%, Fibank said in a statement. This will be the first portfolio investment in Bulgaria for Komarek, owner of KKCG group, which controls one of the largest lottery operators in Europe, SAZKA, and is active in oil and gas, IT and investments. Forbes estimates his net worth at $3.6 billion.    “Fibank is increasing its capital with 195.4 million levs, which will bring the bank’s total capital adequacy ratio to 22.5% compared to 19.6% at the end of March,” the bank said. The new shares were bought by the two investors at 5 levs per share, a serious premium to the current market price. Following the announcement, Fibank shares rose by 3.1% to 2.66 levs per share. The government has said the coronavirus crisis had hit investors’ appetite and the state had to step in to ensure Bulgaria would meet all requirements to enter the euro zone’s “waiting room”. An opposition politician has filed a claim with a Bulgarian court contesting the government’s decision to buy 70% of Fibank’s capital increase for about 136 million levs at a price almost double the market one.     Stakes in Fibank owned by Bulgarian businessmen Tseko Minev and Ivailo Mutafchiev, who each had 42.5%, are diluted after the issue, but together they will remain majority shareholders. The remaining shares are traded at the Sofia bourse.

REUTERS/ Hamad I MohammedLONDON (Reuters) - S&P Global warned that Dubai’s economy was set to shrink 11% this year, as it cut the credit ratings of two of the emirate’s biggest property firms to ‘junk’ status. Dubai, the Middle East’s trade and tourism hub, has been hit hard by coronavirus-containment measures and is set for an economic contraction almost four times worse than during the global financial crisis in 2009, S&P said. “We now expect Dubai’s real GDP will shrink by about 11% in 2020, compounding the economic slowdown that began in 2015,” S&P analysts wrote in a note dated July 9, adding that the emirate’s fiscal deficit was expected to balloon to about 4% of GDP this year. A growth rebound of about 5% is expected next year, but real GDP growth will then slow to 2% through to 2023, which would be half of what it has averaged for the last 10 years.  S&P downgraded Emaar Properties EMAR.DU, the United Arab Emirate’s largest property firm and the builder of the world’s tallest building, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, to a BB+ ‘junk’ rating from an investment grade BBB- score. It said it expected a 30%-40% slump in Emaar’s earnings in 2020, a 15%-20% dive in overall revenues, while the anticipated recovery next year would be only partial. DIFC Investments, a unit of the company running Dubai’s International Financial Center free zone, was cut to BB+ from BBB- as well.  “We expect Dubai’s balance sheet to deteriorate, reducing its ability to provide extraordinary financial support to its related entities,” S&P’s analysts said.

The second-largest US automaker has reached out to lenders within its top 20 bank group for a one-year extension of its US$3.35bn three-year main corporate revolving credit facility and US$2bn three-year supplemental revolving credit facility. The BB+/Ba1/BB+ automaker is seeking to refinance for the first time since downgrades in March removed its last investment grade rating. The move will test banks’ willingness to lend to a US household name in an industry that has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The company is offering an all-in spread of 225bp over Libor, split between a drawn spread of 175bp and an undrawn fee of 50bp for the main corporate and supplemental revolving credit facilities, one of the sources said. All lenders who agree to the extension will receive a 40bp fee on the amount extended. Lenders who choose not to extend will remain in the existing loans at a current all-in spread of 175bp over Libor, split between a drawn spread of 147.5bp and an undrawn fee of 27.5bp for the main corporate and supplemental revolving credit facilities. The company is leaving unchanged its fully funded US$1.5bn supplemental term loan and a US$10.05bn five-year corporate revolving credit facility tranche. JP Morgan leads the deal. Ford reported a 33.3% drop in US sales in the second quarter tied to shutdowns and shelter-in-place orders due to the coronavirus, the company said in a July 2 press release. Ford first reached out to its JP Morgan-led bank group in February to refinance US$15.4bn in revolving credits but in March decided to draw down on the facility and postponed its refinancing plans as market conditions deteriorated, two banking sources said at the time. Ford drew US$13.4bn under its corporate credit facility - including the three-year corporate revolver it is seeking to extend - as well as US$2bn under its three-year supplemental credit facility, for a total of US$15.4bn. The company said borrowings would be used to “offset the temporary working capital impacts of the coronavirus-related production shutdowns and to preserve Ford’s financial flexibility,” according to a March 19 press release. Commitments on the current extension request are due July 22. A JP Morgan spokesperson declined to comment. Emails to a Ford media relations representative were not returned by press time.

The credit ratings of government-related entities are often seen by investors as a proxy for Dubai, which is not rated by any of the major ratings agencies. S&P Global Ratings downgraded Emaar Properties, builder of the world’s tallest building, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, to a BB+ “junk” rating from an investment grade BBB- score, saying it expected a 30%-40% slump in the firm’s earnings this year. Emaar Malls and DIFC Investments, a unit of the company running Dubai International Financial Centre, the Middle East’s major finance hub, also saw the same rating actions. “Emaar has exposure to two of the biggest sectors of the economy, retail and real estate, and naturally that would affect Dubai’s credit profile,” said Khalid Howladar, head of credit and sukuk advisory at RJ Fleming. The Emaar rating action could possibly translate into some 25 basis points in extra cost for Dubai, if it decides to refinance its upcoming bonds, a fixed income analyst and fund manager said. Dubai’s department of finance declined to comment. The coronavirus crisis has brought to a near standstill vital sectors of the Middle East business and tourism hub. S&P said last week it expected Dubai’s economy to shrink 11% this year, in what would be its largest economic contraction since 1986, according to Refinitiv data. Sources have previously told Reuters Dubai was looking at a number of funding options to weather the crisis this year, including a potential public bond issuance. Emaar’s existing $750 million sukuk, or Islamic bonds, due in 2026, have lost some value following the downgrade, shedding over 20 basis points, according to Refinitiv data.

Last Thursday, an investment firm said that on behalf of Hussain Sajwani - founder and Chairman of DAMAC Properties - and his group, it was exploring the possibility of his buying out minority shareholders and taking the company private. Damac jumped 14.2%, its biggest intraday gain since Aug. 2015, as Dubai’s main share index gained 0.5%.

Saudi Telecom ticked up 0.1% after it extended its memorandum of understanding with Vodafone to acquire the group’s shareholding in Vodafone Egypt. Back in Dubai, Emaar Properties declined 1.5%.

Debt in Africa’s most industrialized economy is set to breach 80% of gross domestic product next year as the government borrows more to bring the coronavirus pandemic under control. Fitch downgraded South Africa’s credit rating deeper into “junk” territory in April, citing the lack of a clear path towards debt stabilisation and higher economic growth. The other top ratings firms, Moody’s and S&P, also rate the country at sub-investment grades. “A continued rise in government debt/GDP and failure to formulate a clear and credible path towards stabilising the government debt/GDP ratio could lead to a further downgrade in South Africa’s ‘BB’ rating, which is on Negative Outlook,” said Jan Friederich, Fitch’s head of Africa sovereign ratings. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said in an emergency budget in June the Treasury would stick to its promise of some 230 billion rand ($13.5 billion) of spending cuts in the short term, a target set in February before the COVID-19 pandemic. “Social and political factors, including exceptionally high inequality, powerful trade unions, and deep divisions within the governing African National Congress, present significant hurdles to fiscal consolidation,” Friederich said in a research report.

"July 2, 2020",BB,"                Oman returns to loan market for US$2bn despite recent downgrade - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Credit RSSJuly 2, 2020 /  5:14 PM / 19 days agoOman returns to loan market for US$2bn despite recent downgradeSandrine Bradley4 Min ReadLONDON, July 2 (LPC) - Oman is in the market for a US$2bn bridge loan from international and regional lenders, which bankers expect the sultanate to complete successfully despite it being downgraded further into junk territory. In March, the sultanate was forced to put a US$2bn sovereign loan on hold after it was hit by falling oil prices, the impact of Covid-19 and a downgrade by Fitch to BB from BB+, making the cost of a loan too expensive. However, as market conditions have improved since March, Oman — one of the weakest economies in the oil-rich Gulf — has returned for a one-year loan, even though it suffered a second downgrade by Moody’s to Ba3 from Ba2 on June 23. The Omani Ministry of Finance sent out a request for proposals to lenders on June 18 and initial commitments are due by the end of this week. Banks are being asked for tickets of US$300m for the role of mandated lead arranger and bookrunner and two regional banks are in the running for the role of coordinator, which will be decided shortly. “There will be a mix of regional and international banks in the deal with a regional bank getting the coordinator role,” a banker said. It will be taken out eventually in the bond markets but it is not clear whether the bridge loan will be syndicated further or will be provided as a club loan. “It depends what interest they get and what banks are willing to do. It could end up a club of around ten lenders,” the banker said. Oman’s Ministry of Finance could not be immediately contacted for comment. CRITICAL STAGE There were some doubt that sovereign would be able to agree a loan this year, burdened by high levels of debt and a deficit that Fitch said in May could climb to around US$12bn in 2020, equating to 18% of GDP. There was a concern that government finances could hit a critical stage and its currency’s US dollar peg would become unstable within a year if it could not access external funding. However, lenders have been willing to resume talks as the initial panic caused by the pandemic eases and oil prices rise, helped by OPEC’s agreement last month to extend oil production cuts until the end of July. “The market is getting better. The sentiment is more positive and lenders’ cost of funds have come down,” a second banker said. Decent pricing and the loan’s short one-year tenor is also expected to help generate interest from relationship lenders. “I think there will be enough appetite for U$2bn. The pricing is attractive, but it will be limited to relationship banks and those who know the Omani government,” the second banker said. SATURATION POINT However, Oman is more vulnerable to oil price swings than most of its wealthier Gulf neighbours and some banks are still cautious about further Omani exposure, having lent a significant amount to it already. In March, Bank Muscat closed a US$650m loan, while in February Oman Gas Co signed an US$800m facility. In the third quarter of 2019, Oman’s Ministry of Finance, Oman Oil Company Exploration & Production and National Bank of Oman also agreed loans of US$1.35bn, US$1bn and US$300m, respectively. “It will be very challenging for some banks. The issue is not just about credit deterioration and downgrades it is also the amount of paper that has come out of what is not a very big country in the last few years.

Coltel issued 10-year bonds with a yield of 4.95% after receiving orders for $3.5 billion. The funds will replace senior bonds issued by Coltel on Sept. 27, 2012. “The resources from this placement will allow the company to advance in the process of substituting financial liabilities and improve its maturity profile, after also achieving very favorable conditions,” Telefonica Colombia’s director of finance management Elena Maestre said in a statement. Coltel, in which Colombia’s government holds a minority stake, operates in the Andean country under the brand Movistar. It offers telephone and mobile services, fiber optic internet connections for homes and digital solutions for businesses, among others.

FILE PHOTO: The sun is seen behind a crude oil pump jack in the Permian Basin in Loving County, Texas, U.S., November 22, 2019.   REUTERS/Angus Mordant Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell 94 cents, or 2.2%, to settle at $42.35 a barrel, after gaining 0.5% on Wednesday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $1.28, or 3.1%, to settle at $39.62 a barrel. “As the U.S., Brazil and other countries continue to get hammered by COVID-19, demand is at stake,” said Louise Dickson, oil markets analyst at Rystad Energy. The United States reported more than 60,000 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, the biggest increase reported by a country in a single day. Coronavirus cases have been on the rise in 42 of the 50 U.S. states over the past two weeks, according to a Reuters analysis.  The fresh surge has prompted states such as California and Texas to reimpose some restrictions. The renewed orders are likely to dent any sustained recovery in fuel demand. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed U.S. gasoline stockpiles fell by 4.8 million barrels last week, much more than analysts expected, as demand hit its highest level since March 20. [EIA/S]  In storage hub Cushing, Oklahoma, crude stockpiles rose around 2 million barrels in the week to Tuesday, traders said, citing a Thursday report from Genscape. In India, fuel demand fell 7.9 percent in June compared with the same month last year, denting market sentiment further on Thursday. “The Indian demand numbers were disappointing,” said Phil Flynn, senior analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “That didn’t fit the narrative we were hearing that India’s economy was bouncing back.” Still, futures have held around $40 a barrel and some analysts expect prices to hold in a range ahead of a meeting on July 15 of the market monitoring panel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies.  Meanwhile, oil supply from Libya remains uncertain. The country, whose ports have been blockaded since January, is trying to resume exports after the state oil firm lifted force majeure at its Es Sider oil terminal on Wednesday. However, a tanker was prevented from loading. A second tanker is currently heading toward the port.

Bankruptcies surged in the second quarter, including from major shale independents Chesapeake Energy and Whiting Petroleum, as oil prices collapsed due to the pandemic and a brief, unexpected price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.  There were 18 producer bankruptcies in the second quarter, according to a report compiled by law firm Haynes & Boone, the highest quarterly figure since the second quarter of 2016, when there were 34 bankruptcies. In total, 23 oil producers and 18 oilfield service firms have sought protection from creditors this year.  U.S. crude oil futures are currently about $40 a barrel, a level that “is not a sufficient clearing price for many heavily leveraged shale producers,” the report said.  Lawyers for the firm warned that a recent resurgence in COVID-19 cases around the world would likely hurt near-term demand growth for fuel.  “Lower for longer remains the watchword for producers and their creditors,” attorneys wrote.  In the second quarter alone, producers filing for bankruptcy held over $29 billion in debt, with shale pioneer Chesapeake Energy accounting for $9 billion of that. In total, exploration and production firms filing for bankruptcy this year have $30.6 billion in debt.  Oilfield service firms that filed in 2020 had $23.8 billion in debt, led by Diamond Offshore Drilling at $11.8 billion.

Prices were boosted after data from the Energy Information Administration showed U.S. crude inventories fell 7.5 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2.1 million-barrel drop. [EIA/S] “The story of the report is we will see more draws in the coming weeks,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group. “We will see tightening of supplies and the market is signalling that we are going to need more oil pretty soon, probably by August.” The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, have been cutting output since May by 9.7 million barrels per day (bpd), or 10% of global supply, after the virus destroyed a third of global demand.  After July, the record cuts are due to taper to 7.7 million bpd until December. Saudi Arabia’s energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said OPEC+ was moving to the next phase of its oil cut pact when the group is expected to ease their reductions as oil demand recovers. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said a partial restoration of production would benefit the market and that Russia would raise oil output by around 400,000 bpd from August. “OPEC+ managed to orchestrate the greatest balancing act ever seen in oil market history. But now, the alliance is ready to start concluding the show,” said Rystad Energy’s senior oil markets analyst Paola Rodriguez-Masiu. “We see the increase in OPEC+ production boosting crude exports from August onwards as the alliance gradually reopens the oil taps.”  On Tuesday, OPEC said it saw demand recovering by 7 million bpd in 2021 after falling by 9 million bpd this year. [OPEC/M] Related CoverageOPEC+ eases record oil cuts as economy recovers from pandemicThe global benchmark Brent has recovered to about $43 a barrel from a 21-year low below $16 in April. The rebound in prices has allowed some U.S. producers to resume suspended production, a move that is set to weigh on OPEC’s decision on Wednesday. Prices were also supported by promising early data for a potential COVID-19 vaccine, but the resurgence of the coronavirus in the United States and other countries still kept traders on edge. “Although the demand for crude has jumped in recent weeks, rising coronavirus cases in the United States along with some cities in other major economies reimposing shutdowns have the potential to hit demand,” Lukman Otunuga, senior research analyst at FXTM.

Brent crude fell 13 cents, or 0.3%, at $43.66 a barrel by 0015 GMT, and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude dropped 18 cents, or 0.4%, to $41.02 a barrel. They rose 2% the previous day, helped by the U.S. crude inventories drop. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, known as OPEC+, agreed on Wednesday to scale back oil production cuts from August as the global economy slowly recovers from the coronavirus pandemic. OPEC+ has been cutting output since May by 9.7 million barrels per day, or 10% of global supply, but from August, cuts will officially taper to 7.7 million bpd until December. “Some investors took profits after the OPEC+ decision, but a big draw in U.S. crude provided some support,” Kazuhiko Saito, chief analyst at Fujitomi Co said. Data from the Energy Information Administration showed U.S. crude inventories fell 7.5 million barrels last week, shrinking much more than the 2.1 million-barrel drop expected by analysts in a Reuters poll. Despite the official OPEC+ accord, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said production cuts in August and September would end up amounting to about 8.1 million-8.3 million bpd, more than the headline number. That’s because countries in the grouping which over-produced earlier this year would compensate by making extra August-September cuts, the minister said. Still, oil prices are expected to remain static as an increase in crude processed by refineries is likely to offset higher supply volumes, Rystad Energy said in a note. “We find that prices will have to stay where they are for the rest of 2020 as any uptick will hurt already struggling refining margins and negatively impact the most-needed recovery in refinery runs,” it said. Elsewhere, International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Wednesday that global oil markets are slowly rebalancing after the shocks seen during the coronavirus lockdown, with prices expected at about $40/barrel in the coming months.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, have been cutting output since May by 9.7 million barrels per day, or 10% of global supply, after the virus destroyed a third of global demand. After July, the cuts are due to taper to 7.7 million bpd until December. A panel involving key ministers and known as the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) meets on Wednesday after 12 GMT to recommend the next level of cuts. Five OPEC+ sources have said no recommendations have been made to prolong record cuts into August. OPEC’s secretary general Mohammad Barkindo said this week the oil market was getting closer to balance. On Tuesday, OPEC said it saw demand recovering by 7 million bpd in 2021 after falling by 9 million this year. Oil prices have recovered to almost $43 a barrel from a 21-year low below $16 in April. The recovery in prices have allowed some U.S. producers to resume suspended production, a sign that is set to weigh on OPEC’s decision on Wednesday. The real production increase from August could be less than 2 million bpd given Iraq, Nigeria and Angola promised to over-comply to make up for high output in May-June. Saudi Arabia’s oil exports in August will remain the same as in July as the extra barrels the kingdom is set to pump will be used domestically, industry sources told Reuters.

FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed oil pump jack is seen in front of displayed Opec logo in this illustration picture, April 14, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File PhotoThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known as OPEC+, have been cutting output since May by 9.7 million barrels per day, or 10% of global supply, after the virus destroyed a third of global demand. From August, cuts will officially taper to 7.7 million bpd until December. However, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said the effective curbs would be deeper because countries which overproduced in May-June would make extra cuts in August and September to make up, so total cuts would end up amounting to about 8.1 million to 8.3 million bpd. “As we move to the next phase of the agreement the extra supply resulting from the scheduled easing of production cuts will be consumed as demand continues on its recovery path,” Prince Abdulaziz after a meeting of a ministerial advisory panel to OPEC+, known as the JMMC. He said Saudi oil exports in August would remain the same as in July because about 0.5 million bpd of extra barrels the kingdom was set to pump would be used domestically. Oil prices LCOc1 have recovered to almost $43 a barrel from a 21-year low below $16 in April.  The recovery has allowed some U.S. producers to resume production. Russia and OPEC rely heavily on oil revenue but they will be keen not to push prices too high to give a further boost to rival U.S. oil output growth. On Tuesday, OPEC said it saw demand recovering by 7 million bpd in 2021 after falling by 9 million this year.  However, fears of a second wave of coronavirus are weighing heavily on the market and OPEC+ said in documents seen by Reuters that “a second strong wave” could deepen the hit to demand to 11 million bpd this year. Under such a negative scenario, OPEC would fail to address a huge global stocks overhang by the end of the year, it said. Such a scenario could also put in jeopardy OPEC’s plans to supply an extra 6 million bpd of crude to the market next year.      “The expected forecast draws are at the mercy of the outcome of the COVID crisis and could be weighed down further by the prospect of Libya’s production coming back,” said Paola Rodriguez-Masiu from Rystad Energy. Production from Libya, an OPEC member exempt from output cuts, has been hit because of the turmoil in the North African country, but the national oil company is working to pump more. “The Americas region could throw a spanner in the rebalancing act as daily infections continue to rise and some states consider new restrictions,” Rodriguez-Masiu added.  OPEC+ holds the JMMC meeting on Aug. 18.

"December 20, 2016",BBU,"                Fitch Affirms Banesco USA's LT IDR at 'B+'; Outlook Revised to Positive - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States IntelDecember 20, 2016 /  8:45 PM / 4 years agoFitch Affirms Banesco USA's LT IDR at 'B+'; Outlook Revised to Positive18 Min Read(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Banesco USA's (BNSC)  Long- and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'B+'/'B'. The Rating  Outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable. A full list of rating actions  follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS AND VIABILITY RATINGS Today's action reflects BNSC's improvements in business and financial  performance. To date, the company has exhibited improving trends across asset  quality, profitability and capitalization measures. Further, the company  continues to build its South Florida franchise by focusing on domestic lending  and deposit-gathering activities.  The Rating Outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable to reflect our  expectation that the company will demonstrate sustained improvement in financial  measures, particularly earnings and asset quality. Furthermore, Fitch would  expect continued execution of strategic initiatives such as diversification of  the deposit base and targeted growth in foreign correspondent banking  relationships. Strategic initiatives include leveraging affiliated Banesco  companies such as ABANCA (BB+/bb+/Stable) in Spain to grow loans and deposits  within the Spanish-speaking community in Florida and gain additional foreign  correspondent banking relationships. BNSC has also started an online deposit  platform, providing an additional source of funding.   Fitch's rating action incorporates the view that the bank has made improvements  in risk management, controls, and oversight across its major risk exposures  following the Consent Order in 2013 related to the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and  Anti-Money Laundering (AML) deficiencies.  Such improvements include a formal  board-approved enterprise risk management (ERM) policy and the implementation of  BSA/AML oversight tools and processes to monitor and manage potential high risk  activities. As these improvements season, they should help to inculcate a  compliance-focused culture across the BNSC organization.  In April 2016, the bank's Consent Order related to deficiencies in its  compliance with BSA and AML laws and regulations was lifted by the FDIC and the  Florida Office of Financial Regulation.  Fitch believes BNSC's current and expected earnings are satisfactory, and are in  line relative to many other Fitch rated community banks. During 2016, the  company improved its ROA and ROE measures to 57bps and 6.1%, respectively. In  our view, this trend is likely sustainable over the very near term, as the  company continues to report positive operating leverage driven by a significant  reduction in costs associated with efforts to support its BSA/AML remediation.  Over the medium term, the cost reductions noted above are likely to be tempered  by a flat net interest margin (NIM). Looking forward, we believe large gains in  profitability are limited, as the bank focuses on diversifying its deposit mix  by adding more domestically-sourced deposits, which are higher cost. We expect  that 2017 earnings measures will be in line with current levels. Fitch views BNSC's credit performance to date as commensurate with the current  rating level and continue to expect improvement. Fitch calculates BNSC's NPAs  (non-performing assets; includes loans 90 days past due and still accruing,  accruing TDRs, and OREO) at 1.76% as of third quarter 2016 (3Q16). We also note  that a reduction in NPAs during 2016 has not come with higher credit costs as  evidenced by near-zero NCOs-to-average assets over the past five quarters. However, BNSC's strong growth in recent years, its concentration in commercial  real estate (CRE), and its geographic concentration in South Florida are viewed  by Fitch as rating constraints relative to similarly rated peers. Fitch  recognizes, however, that CRE concentration in local markets such as South  Florida tends to be above community bank averages. In addition, the CRE  concentration could drive some modest volatility in NPA measures, but at this  stage Fitch believes credit losses should be manageable. The company is  expanding its foreign correspondent bank activities in select countries  including the Dominican Republic and Spain as well as growing CRE and commercial  & industrial (C&I) loans. BNSC's capitalization is appropriate for its risk  profile; however, the lack of access to external capital is considered a rating  constraint.  As of Sept. 30, 2016, the bank's Fitch core capital/risk-weighted  assets ratio was 12.35% and its tangible common equity/tangible assets ratio was  9.75%. Although Fitch considers the capital base sufficient to support risks  within the business mix, a return to high loan growth coupled with limited  profitability may impact capital ratios. Although BNSC is affiliated with the Banesco Group and shares common ownership,  BNSC does not have a holding company structure and there is no direct ownership  linkage to Banesco Banco Universal (BBU) in Venezuela. BNSC benefits from the  ""Banesco"" brand, its strong recognition in Latin America, and BBU's  market-leading position in Venezuela. BBU is Venezuela's largest privately held  bank in terms of deposits and assets. In Fitch's opinion, contagion risk from  BBU, which shares the same brand, is limited at this time. The company's liquidity profile is driven by its large core deposit base that  relies on a high volume of international deposits, which make up about 50% of  total deposits. The majority of international funding is sourced from Venezuelan  depositors who have turned to U.S. banks as a safe haven. These deposits  typically have a very low attrition rate, limited rate sensitivity, and provide  a stable source of low-cost funding. However, deposit inflows are expected to be  limited and the company may experience some outflows driven by rising inflation  in Venezuela. In an effort to reduce reliance on Venezuelan funding, management  has been working to grow domestic deposits in conjunction with loan growth.  Fitch views the diversification of funding sources positively. Furthermore, BNSC  maintains a high level of cash and liquid assets as well as secondary liquidity  sources to support immediate liquidity needs. Fitch notes that there may be risks to BNSC's Venezuelan depositors seeking  other U.S.-based banking institutions in which to deposit their monies in the  event there are concerns regarding BNSC or the Banesco Group. However, to date,  BNSC has actually benefited from its association with the Banesco brand, despite  volatility in Venezuela, as demonstrated by its relatively stable deposit base  overall. Fitch notes that depositor behavior has thus far been manageable;  however, should a significant change in depositor behavior become evident,  BNSC's ratings may be impacted. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  BNSC has a Support Rating (SR) of '5' and Support Rating Floor (SRF) of 'NF'. In  Fitch's view, BNSC is not systemically important and, therefore, the probability  of support is unlikely. The IDRs and Viability Ratings (VRs) do not incorporate  any support. Historically, BNSC's principal shareholders have demonstrated a  willingness to provide capital; however, Fitch's rating analysis does not assume  capital support from the shareholders. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS BNSC's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one-notch higher than the company's  IDR because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from depositor preference. U.S.  depositor preference gives deposit liabilities superior recovery prospects in  the event of default. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND VRS BNCS's ratings may be upgraded with continuing improvement in financial  performance, particularly earnings and asset quality measures, and demonstrated  execution of its deposit diversification and loan growth strategies within the  context of its enhanced risk management function.  The Rating Outlook could return to Stable or the rating could even be downgraded  should the company exhibit aggressive organic loan growth. This risk is further  accentuated given Banesco's already significant growth in CRE and commercial C&I  loans through a relatively benign credit environment. Should credit losses  deteriorate significantly, thereby impacting capital, negative rating action  could ensue.  While not anticipated, given BNSC's ties to the Banesco Group and considerable  Venezuelan deposit base, material changes in deposit behavior leading to  unexpected deposit outflows could also result in negative rating action.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  BNSC's SR and SRF are sensitive to Fitch's assumption around capacity to procure  extraordinary support in case of need. Since BNSC's SR and SR Floor are '5' and  'NF', respectively, there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change  over the foreseeable future.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS  The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by BNSC are primarily  sensitive to any change in BNSC's Long- and Short-Term IDRs.  PROFILE Banesco USA was established in 2006 by the principal shareholders of the Banesco  Group and provides traditional banking services, primarily real estate  financing, to retail clients as well as to small-to-medium-sized companies.  Services are offered via a total of five branches with two in Miami-Dade County,  two in Broward County and one in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Banesco USA is based in  Coral Gables, FL. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  Banesco USA (BNSC) --Long-Term IDR at 'B+'; Outlook revised to Positive from Stable; --Short-Term IDR at 'B'; --Long-term deposits at 'BB-'; --Short-term deposits at 'B'; --Viability Rating at 'b+'; --Support at '5'; --Support Floor at 'NF'.

In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or  dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to  use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed  under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act  of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular  jurisdiction.

"February 27, 2012",BBW,"                TEXT-S&P changes Limited Brands s-t rating to 'B' - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Bonds NewsFebruary 27, 2012 /  10:51 PM / 8 years agoTEXT-S&P changes Limited Brands s-t rating to 'B'7 Min ReadFeb 27 - Overview	     -- Standard & Poor's is conducting a review of existing short-term 	ratings using new rating definitions.	     -- We are revising the short-term rating on Limited Brands to 'B' from 	'B-1' because of the change in our criteria.	     -- At the same time, we are affirming all other ratings and outlook, 	including the 'BB+' corporate credit rating.	     -- The stable outlook on Limited Brands reflects our view that the 	company's financial policies will remain aggressive, but that it will manage 	its shareholder activities, with leverage at about 3x over the near term.	 	Rating Action	On Feb. 27, 2012, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services changed the short-term 	rating on Limited Brands to 'B' from 'B-1' following the revision of 	short-term rating definitions for the 'B' category, and the removal of the 	'B-1', 'B-2', and 'B-3' rating definitions. At the same time, we are affirming 	all other ratings on the company, including the 'BB+' corporate credit rating. 	The outlook is stable.	 	Rationale	The ratings on Columbus, Ohio-based apparel retailer Limited Brands Inc. 	reflect Standard & Poor's Ratings Services' expectation for further 	performance gains during 2012--though at a lower rate than the previous 	year--and for financial policies to remain aggressive. Both its Victoria's 	Secret (VS) and Bath & Body Works (BBW) divisions are relatively mature, and 	historically have provided consistent and solid cash flows.		Pro forma for the $1 billion unsecured debt offering, we expect leverage to be 	in the low-3x area, but consistent positive EBITDA growth is likely to reduce 	leverage to about 3x over the near term. Over the next year, we expect 	interest coverage to be about 4x and funds from operations (FFO) to total debt 	to be in the low-20% range. The ""significant"" financial risk profile (as our 	criteria define the term) incorporates our belief that the company's financial 	policies will remain aggressive. Despite this, we expect that the company will 	manage its leverage to about 3x over the near term. The company's 	""satisfactory"" business risk profile incorporates its participation in the 	intensely competitive specialty retail industry, satisfactory market positions 	in intimate apparel and personal care products, and geographic diversity.		Although we anticipate Limited Brands will retain its performance momentum 	over the near term, we expect it to continue at a lower rate. We believe 	consolidated same-store sales are likely to be in the low-single digits as the 	tepid economy mutes consumer spending. We expect margins to benefit slightly 	from further operational leverage and lower product costs over the near term. 	We anticipate EBITDA margins will remain slightly above 20% over the near term.	 	Liquidity	Our 'B' short-term rating on Limited Brands reflects our long-term issuer 	rating and our view that liquidity is ""strong."" We expect sources of cash to 	exceed uses over the next 12 months. Cash sources include about $1 billion of 	cash on hand, free operating cash flow of about $600 million, and availability 	under its revolving credit facility, which we estimate was unused as of Jan. 	31, 2012. Cash uses are likely to be about $600 million of capital 	expenditures, some modest investment in working capital, and $58 million of 	debt maturities in December 2012.		Other relevant aspects of the company's liquidity, in our view, are as follows:	     -- We estimate coverage of sources over uses to be above 1.5x.	     -- We expect net sources would be positive, even with a 30% decline in 	EBITDA.	     -- Ample cushion under its financial performance covenants.	     -- Well-established and solid relationships with its banks.		Recovery analysis	Our issue-level rating on Limited Brands' unsecured notes with subsidiary 	guarantees is 'BB+' (the same as the corporate credit rating) and the recovery 	rating on the notes is '3', indicating our expectation for meaningful (50% to 	70%) recovery in the event of a payment default.		The issue-level rating on the unsecured notes without subsidiary guarantees is 	'BB-' (two notches below the corporate credit rating) and the recovery rating 	on the notes is '6', indicating our expectation for negligible (0% to 10%) 	recovery in the event of a payment default. (For the complete recovery 	analysis, please see Standard & Poor's recovery report on Limited Brands, 	published on Feb. 17, 2012 on RatingsDirect.)	 	Outlook	The stable outlook on Limited Brands reflects our view that the company's 	financial policies will remain aggressive, but that it will manage its 	shareholder activities, with leverage at about 3x over the near term. The 	outlook also incorporates our view that the company will demonstrate modest 	performance gains over the next year, but at a lower rate than the prior year.		We could lower the rating if additional shareholder-friendly activities or 	erosion in performance results in leverage above 3.5x. An example of this 	scenario would be if the company issued more than $750 million of additional 	debt while performance growth is in the low-single digits.		An upgrade is unlikely over the near term because we currently assess the 	company's financial risk profile below investment-grade and believe that the 	financial policies will remain aggressive over the intermediate term. However, 	we could upgrade the company if we received further clarity into its long-term 	financial policy with respect to dividends, share repurchases, and debt 	issuance. Additionally, the company would have to demonstrate stronger credit 	protection measures, with leverage in the low-2x area and interest coverage 	approaching 6x.

The Support Rating (SR) and Support Rating Floor (SRF) reflect an extremely high probability of support being provided by the Kuwaiti authorities to all domestic banks if needed. This is reflected in BBY's SR of '1' and SRF of 'A+', in line with Fitch's Domestic-Systemically Important Bank SRF. Fitch's expectation of support from the authorities is underpinned by Kuwait's strong ability to provide support to domestic banks, as reflected by the sovereign rating (AA/Stable) and a strong willingness to do so irrespective of the banks' size, franchise, funding structure and the level of government ownership. This view is reinforced by the authorities' track record of support for the domestic banking system in case of need. The Central Bank of Kuwait operates a strict regime with hands-on monitoring to ensure the viability of the banks, and has acted swiftly in the past to provide support where needed. Contagion risk among domestic banks is high (Kuwait is a small and interconnected market) and we believe this is an added incentive to provide state support to any Kuwaiti bank if needed, to maintain market confidence and stability. The Stable Outlook on BBY's Long-Term IDR reflects that on the Kuwaiti sovereign rating. We assign Short-Term IDRs according to the mapping correspondence described in our bank rating criteria. An 'A+' Long-Term IDR can correspond to a Short-Term IDR of either 'F1' or 'F1+'. In the case of BBY, we opted for 'F1', the lower of the two Short-Term IDR options. This is because a significant proportion of the Kuwaiti banking sector funding is related to the government and a stress scenario for the banks is likely to come at a time when the sovereign itself is experiencing some form of stress. VR BBY continues to benefit from a fairly stable operating environment in Kuwait despite the economic impact of low oil prices. The bank is exposed to lower economic growth, but Fitch believes that the government's continuing capital spending plans will partially offset the pressures. BBY has a moderate but growing franchise in Kuwait, underpinned by being part of the National Bank of Kuwait (NBK) group. BBY's domestic-led business model is supported by the bank's fintech-oriented retail offering, which underpins deposit collection. The bank has a competent management team that is highly experienced in local banking and includes managers previously employed by NBK. BBY's strategic objectives have proven to be consistent, sustainable and are articulated around domestic- and organic-led growth. Management has demonstrated an effective strategy implementation record despite high balance sheet growth. Fitch's assessment incorporates BBY's high risk appetite for domestic growth. BBY also remains highly concentrated by sector and single obligor. The bank is highly exposed to domestic real estate, a sector that can be volatile and has seen lower prices and sales in 2016 and 1H17. Fitch also factors in the benefits of BBY's adequate risk controls and management from the bank being part of the NBK group. BBY's financing-quality is resilient, with one of the lowest impaired financing ratios across the sector (0.6% at end-1H17) and very low problem financing generation. Reserve coverage continues to be high (although lower than peers) due to the prudent actions of the Central Bank of Kuwait requiring the build-up of precautionary reserves. Fitch believes this is necessary in light of the bank's significant concentration by sector and single obligor due to Kuwait's narrow economy. Concentrations and risk appetite will remain constraints on asset quality. BBY's profitability is stable and higher than peers' (annualised operating profit/risk-weighted assets ratio was 2.2% in 1H17). Growth supports earnings generation. Stable net special commission margins, cost-efficiency and impairment charges underpin the bank's profitability. The bank's earnings are primarily generated from net financing income and fees and commission from corporate and retail customers, predominantly real estate segments, and therefore would remain sensitive to domestic economic cycles. The bank's capital ratios compare well with peers'. The bank's fast growth and the implementation of Basel 3 have reduced capitalisation levels and buffers over minimum requirements. The risk absorption capacity of the bank's capital is adequate, supported by resilient asset quality. The bank's dividend pay-out ratio is lower than peers' and supports internal capital generation. Fitch believes that BBY has the capacity to raise capital if needed, with support from NBK. The bank successfully issued perpetual tier 1 sukuk for USD250 million in May 2016 to fund growth. Large concentrations will remain the main risk. Similar to peers, BBY's high reliance on wholesale funding (57% of customer deposits at end-1H17, albeit below peers') results in deposit concentration (the top 20 deposits represented 53% of total at end-1H17), primarily from government-related entities and large corporates. The deposit base has been historically stable, mitigating liquidity maturity mismatches. BBY's liquidity is well-managed and liquidity risk remains contained. The Fitch calculated financing/deposits ratio (89% at end-1H17) is stable and in line with peer average. Liquidity flexibility is underpinned by an adequate stock of liquid assets (20% of total assets and 24% of customer deposits at end-1H17). RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRs, SR, SRF BBY's IDRs, SR and SRF are sensitive to a change in Fitch's assumptions around the Kuwaiti authorities' propensity or ability to provide timely support to the banking sector or the bank. At present, we do not see much likelihood of a change. VR An improvement in BBY's franchise, sustainable financing growth without material asset-quality deterioration or a significant reduction of concentrations could be positive for the bank's VR. The VR is sensitive to continuing rapid financing growth leading to asset-quality deterioration or weakening capital ratios.

"March 1, 2017",BBY,"                Best Buy surprises with weak holiday sales, bleak forecast - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsMarch 1, 2017 /  12:17 PM / 3 years agoBest Buy surprises with weak holiday sales, bleak forecastRicha Naidu4 Min Read(Reuters) - Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) reported an unexpected decline in same-store sales for the holiday quarter and warned of another surprise drop this quarter, highlighting electronic retailers’ ongoing struggles with competition from online stores. A Best Buy store is pictured in Pasadena, California U.S., February 28, 2017.   REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni Best Buy, the No.1 U.S. electronics retailer, blamed lackluster demand for tablets, wearable devices and mobile phones, the markets for which are highly saturated. “We don’t expect significant growth in (mobile phones) from a market standpoint” Chief Executive Hubert Joly said on an analyst call on Wednesday, adding that buying a phone at any retailer was a “painful” experience. Best Buy also cited weak sales of gaming consoles, something that also weighed on video game retailer GameStop Corp (GME.N), whose results were hit by players downloading games instead of buying them in stores. U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers are under pressure from slow economic growth as well as competition from the likes of Amazon (AMZN.O). Underscoring the pain, electronics retailer hhgregg Inc HGGG.PK is reportedly expected to file for bankruptcy this month. Joly said, without naming the company, that the potential bankruptcy would free up $1 billion in revenue to be shared across the industry, although this would not be “transformative” for Best Buy. The company shares were down 4.5 percent on Wednesday, nearly identical to their decline a day earlier, when retailers across the board fell in sympathy with Target Corp (TGT.N) after it gave a dismal full-year forecast. “We think lackluster mobile, some product outages, and worse gaming (in a quarter that matters) are the forces at work — not a sudden shift to a less relevant BBY,” Consumer Edge Research retail analyst David Schick. SALES HIT Best Buy kept a tight lid on costs in the fourth quarter, which helped its net income increase 27 percent and its adjusted earnings of $1.95 per share beat Wall Street estimates by 28 cents. However, sales at the company’s stores open for more than a year fell 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter, widely missing the increase of 0.5 percent analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix were expecting. Best Buy said it expects sales at its established stores to drop 1-2 percent in the current quarter. Analysts were expecting an increase of 0.7 percent, according to Consensus Metrix. The company’s revenue fell to $13.48 billion from $13.62 billion in the quarter ended Jan. 28, missing analysts’ estimate of $13.62 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Joly said the unavailability of some products could have cost Best Buy about $200 million in sales, while Samsung Electronics’ (005930.KS) Galaxy Note 7 smartphone recall took an identical toll. But, with fewer planned cost cuts and innovative new electronics on the horizon, analysts have voiced concerns that 2018 could be a tough year for Best Buy, which has relied on buybacks to drive earnings per share growth. Best Buy on Wednesday accelerated its share buyback plan to $3 billion over two years from $1 billion over two, and also hiked its quarterly dividend.

"November 8, 2019",BBY,"                Heavy rains slow EU winter crop sowings, disrupt maize harvest - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States EnvironmentNovember 8, 2019 /  11:42 AM / 8 months agoHeavy rains slow EU winter crop sowings, disrupt maize harvest3 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Heavy rains have delayed grain sowings in parts of the European Union with the situation particularly severe in Britain where they could trigger a significant shift to spring planted crops. FILE PHOTO - Combines harvest wheat in a field in near Sarmzalino, Macedonia July 13, 2018. REUTERS/Ognen TeofilovskiThe rains have also disrupted the harvesting of maize and sugar beet, adding to the challenge faced by farmers who are trying to get winter crops planted. “Overall it is estimated that wheat plantings are just about 40-50% complete in the UK. We still have a bit of time but the weather forecast is far from ideal,” said Ben Bodart, Director at CRM AgriCommodities. Bodart noted the last time that Britain had significant planting issues was for the 2013/14 campaign when the final wheat area fell by nearly 19%. UK wheat futures on ICE have been rising sharply for 2020/21 crop positions with the Nov. 2020 contract climbing to a peak of 160.00 pounds a ton on Thursday, up 10% from a month earlier. “Some farmers are already considering rolling their 2019 harvest over to sell it next season,” Bodart said. In France, winter barley is most at risk of losing area because of its earlier planting period compared with wheat. However, the main threat from rain was to the ongoing maize harvest, with potential for disease in late-gathered crop, analysts and traders said. “The rain has hampered winter barley sowing quite a bit in France and the UK, and there will be some sowing intentions that won’t be fulfilled,” Benoit Fayaud of crop analysts Strategie Grains said. “It’s also slowing soft wheat sowing but there’s a longer window than for winter barley.” French farmers had sown 67% of the expected soft wheat area as of Nov. 4, with sowing now eight days behind the average of the past five years, according to farming agency FranceAgriMer. Winter barley sowing was 81% complete and also eight days behind the five-year average. German winter grains sowings have also been delayed. “It is the winter grain sowings on the harvested maize and sugar fields which are being delayed, earlier sowings went very well,” one German grains analyst said. “Currently it is not a very serious problem but it is making estimates of the winter wheat planted area for next summer’s crop difficult as we do not know if some farmers will be compelled to move to planting more spring grains.” Poland also had a rainy autumn, but with enough sunny days allowing farmers to sow winter crops, said Wojtek Sabaranski of analysts Sparks Polska. “Polish farmers have generally managed to plant winter crops in a timely manner,” Sabaranski said. “Warm weather helped establish winter crops already sown and enabled maize harvesting to run at a pretty good pace.”      Reporting by Nigel Hunt in London, Gus Trompiz in Paris and Michael Hogan in Hamburg; Editing bby Giles ElgoodOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

FILE PHOTO: Enel CEO Francesco Starace attends the Brazil Investment Forum in Sao Paulo, Brazil October 10, 2019. REUTERS/Amanda Perobelli“We are not in a hurry”, Enel CEO Francesco Starace told reporters during the utility’s capital market day in Milan, adding that it did not intend to walk out of the Open Fiber joint-venture.  Telecom Italia (TIM) is negotiating with Enel and state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) on ways of integrating with Open Fiber to create a national fiber champion and avoid costly duplication of investment. Open Fiber, a wholesale-only fast broadband operator, is jointly owned by Enel and CDP, which is also TIM’s second-largest shareholder. But Starace has so far shown little enthusiasm in parting ways with the fiber business. “There is no tendency to walk out of the Open Fiber joint-venture ... it needs serious consideration,” he said. Besides regulatory issues, one stumbling block in the project has been how much Open Fiber is worth.  In a bid to bypass the obstacle, Telecom Italia is asking infrastructure funds to come up with bids for the assets of Open Fiber that will include its own last-mile network. Enel values the business it set up in 2014 at up to 8 billion euros, while analysts estimates it could be worth somewhere in the range of 1.5-4.0 billion euros.  “For us, Open Fiber is a big company that creates value,” Starace said. He said he had not sat down with any of the infrastructure funds sounded out by TIM. According to a source close to the matter last week, 6 or 7 infrastructure funds had so far expressed an interest in teaming up with TIM in a possible investment in Open Fiber. Telecom Italia was not immediately available for comment.

The central bank hopes to grow its reserves by $300 million in 2016, it said. The country’s gold and foreign exchange reserves have dropped by $400 million to $4.6 billion this year. In the first half of this year the central bank gave up efforts to keep the rate of the rouble steady and liberalised the forex market. The rouble has depreciated by almost 30 percent since the beginning of 2015.

"June 11, 2020",BC,"                Big rate cut no quick fix for Russian economy - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsJune 11, 2020 /  6:55 AM / a month agoBig rate cut no quick fix for Russian economyAlexander Marrow5 Min ReadMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s central bank has signalled it may cut its benchmark rate next week to the lowest since the collapse of the Soviet Union but even that would only have a limited direct impact on the economy’s post-pandemic recovery, analysts say.     FILE PHOTO: Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina attends a news conference in Moscow, Russia March 22, 2019. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov With its benchmark rate at 5.5%, the Bank of Russia has far more leeway to cut than counterparts in major Western economies where rates are already close to zero or even negative.  But analysts doubt whether even a 100 basis point cut would result in a jump in the broad-based borrowing needed to get the economy going, with gross domestic product expected to shrink by up to 6% this year because of the fallout from the coronavirus.     “There’s not much possibility for the population to take on more debt because of the cap on real income growth and there’s not much demand from the real economy from businesses,” said Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at BCS Global Markets. Governor Elvira Nabiullina has hinted at a 100 basis point cut on June 19, which would be the biggest single reduction since June 2015. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast a 50 basis point cut, with further easing by the end of the year. It’s a far cry from the Russian crises of 2008/09 and 2014/15 when a toxic combination of economic contraction and booming inflation forced the central bank to push rates sharply higher in a bid to support the rouble.  This time inflation is just 3% and real disposable incomes are now projected to shrink by 3.8% in 2020, rather than growing by 1.9% as previously expected, according to the economy ministry.      “The carry-on effect of the rate cut to the economy is likely to be very marginal, very, very small. It won’t be a game-changer for the economy at large,” said Tikhomirov, questioning whether banks would even pass on the cut to customers as their profits had been hit by the pandemic. BOOST FOR PUTIN PROJECTS?     The central bank’s credibility has grown over the past few years under Nabiullina. A year after she become governor in 2013, the bank went through a torrid time and had to raise its key rate by 650 basis points to 17% in December 2014 to rescue the rouble, just after adopting a free-floating currency regime. That year, the bank burned through nearly $80 billion to prop up a currency hit by weak oil prices, Western sanctions against Russia over the annexation of Crimea and the impact of companies needing to repay debt denominated in foreign currency. But interest rates have been on a generally downward trajectory ever since and the central bank cut its key rate by 50 basis points in April to the lowest since the start of 2014. A 100 basis point cut next week would take it down to 4.5%, which would be lowest since the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991. Nevertheless, Dmitry Polevoy, chief economist at the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said a move to a policy of bigger cuts would not have an immediate impact as it takes time for changes in monetary policy to filter through to the real economy. Even cheap loan schemes that have been made available by the government and banks to cushion the fallout from the pandemic have failed to dramatically stimulate spending so far, analysts say.     A policy shift to bigger rate cuts is also not without risks. It could backfire if inflation starts to accelerate faster than forecast, said Ivan Tchakarov, chief economist at Citi for Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.       FILE PHOTO: Elvira Nabiullina, Governor of Russian Central Bank, attends a news conference in Moscow, Russia December 13, 2019. REUTERS/Shamil ZhumatovLower rates could also hit the rouble and lead to more modest returns on governments bonds, or OFZs, which have been snapped up by foreign investors but are already becoming less attractive because of recent rate cuts. One significant benefit of a cut, however, would be to make cheaper money available to the state as it emerges from its lockdown and President Vladimir Putin pushes ahead with $400 billion of economic and social spending on national projects.     “It is money, it is blood for the economy,” Yury Borisov, a deputy prime minister, said last month of the expected rate cut.

BCS is one of the largest brokerages in Russia, which has seen massive private investment inflow to its stock markets in the past two years as bank deposit rates declined during a period of central bank monetary easing.  The number of private investors could reach 7 million by the end of the year, according to analysts at Promsvyazbank, while the Moscow Exchange saw a surge in retail investors in March. The group’s strategy is to achieve a $1 billion valuation for BCS Global Markets by the end of 2022, before going public, according to an article by the daily Kommersant in December 2019.  BCS Global Markets on Thursday told Reuters it was too early to talk about any details and configurations of the deal.  “The new strategy also depends in large part on external factors, which now regularly demonstrate their unpredictable nature,” BCS Global Markets CEO Alexei Gonus told Reuters. BCS Group’s owner and president Oleg Mikhasenko last week said the investment bank was looking to expand into emerging markets beyond Russia.  “All EM markets are very interesting. The strategy involves intensive development into these markets, we will see how the new team does it,” he said, also adding that their goal was to launch an IPO of the investment bank in 2023.

An undated photo provided by the Greek Culture Ministry on June 10, 2020, shows an 8th century B.C. horse figurine of the Ancient Greek Geometric period. Greek Culture Ministry/Handout via REUTERS Lina Mendoni said Tuesday’s ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had set a precedent and recognised countries’ sovereign right to call for the return of artefacts. However the court has left unresolved the fundamental issue of who owns the horse. The Greek government wrote to Sotheby’s auction house in 2018 asking it to stop a sale of the 8th century BC statue, saying it was Greek national property, according to the text of the appeals court ruling. Later that year, Sotheby’s and descendants of art collectors Howard and Saretta Barnet took the unusual step of suing the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports in the U.S. courts, seeking a declaration that the family owned the horse and that Sotheby’s could sell it.  A year later, a US judge rejected Greece’s effort to dismiss that lawsuit. But the appeal court ruled on Tuesday that Greece had been pursuing its sovereign rights, not commercial interests, when making the claim. So under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, Greece could not face such a lawsuit. The appeals court did not rule on who owned the statue.  Culture Minister Mendoni told Reuters TV: “Greece has clearly achieved a huge victory - a legal precedent, a judicial precedent, has already been created, and through Greece, it favours all countries from which cultural goods are illegally exported. “In the same decision, it is recognised that the claiming of cultural rights by a country, by Greece in this case, concerns a sovereign issue, an issue of sovereign rights. This is very, very important,” she added.  Sotheby’s said on Wednesday it was disappointed by the ruling. “There is, and remains, no evidence to support Greece’s claim to ownership of the bronze sculpture. We, together with our client, are reviewing next steps,” it said. Greece has been waging campaigns for decades for the repatriation of antiquities it says have been stolen or illegally excavated.  Its biggest is for the return of the Parthenon Marbles which are on display in the British Museum in London. The British Museum says the marbles were acquired legally.

The people were charged in connection with a 3.5 billion euro ($3.9 billion) special dividend that Seat Pagine Gialle paid in 2004, increasing its debt to 4 billion euros at the end of that year. The company, which was bought by BC Partners, CVC, Investitori Associati and Permira in 2003, never managed to shake off the burden of that indebtedness. It was eventually placed under a court restructuring, similar to Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, in 2013, before being taken over in 2015 by Italiaonline, an Internet company controlled by Egyptian businessman Naguib Sawiris.

REUTERS/Hannah McKayLONDON (Reuters) - Just over a third of companies in Britain believe they can fully restart operations while implementing the government’s coronavirus workplace guidance, a survey showed on Wednesday. The British Chambers of Commerce said 45% of firms it questioned felt they would be able to partly reopen and 10% said they would not be able to operate at all, mostly citing problems with social distancing. The BCC’s director general, Adam Marshall said some sectors still needed clarity from the government on when and how they will be allowed to restart. “This is particularly the case for hospitality and leisure companies, which will not reopen before July at the earliest,” Marshall said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier this month that workers in construction and manufacturing should be encouraged to return to their jobs. Some house-building companies and car manufacturers have resumed operations. The BCC - whose members are typically small firms - said it surveyed 609 businesses between May 13 and May 15. Many firms would see reduced demand because of the government’s broad social distancing guidelines, another factor preventing them from restarting at full capacity, it said.   The survey showed 85% of firms which applied for the government’s wage support for furloughed employees had received payment while 54% of those seeking a 100% state-backed small business loan got the money with 38% waiting for a response.

"May 22, 2020",BCC,"                UK to introduce quarantine for international arrivals from June 8 - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States World NewsMay 22, 2020 /  6:37 AM / 2 months agoUK to introduce quarantine for international arrivals from June 8Alistair Smout, Kylie MacLellan4 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Britain will introduce a COVID-19 quarantine for travellers arriving from abroad from June 8, interior minister Priti Patel said on Friday, a measure that airlines have warned will devastate their industry. All international arrivals, including returning Britons, will have to self-isolate for 14 days and provide details of where they will be staying under the plans, which were criticised by airlines, business groups and politicians alike. “Now we are past the peak of this virus, we must take steps to guard against imported cases triggering a resurgence of this deadly disease,” Patel said at a news conference. Those who breach the quarantine in England could be fined 1,000 pounds ($1,218), and spot checks would be carried out by health and border officials.     The quarantine will not apply to those arriving from the Irish Republic, or to freight drivers, medical professionals and seasonal agricultural workers. The measures will be reviewed every three weeks. [nL8N2D44UM] Transport minister Grant Shapps has suggested the government would seek to negotiate “air bridges” for travellers coming from countries with low virus infection rates. In France, Britain’s closest neighbour on the continent of Europe, the government said it regretted Britain’s decision. It stood ready to impose reciprocal measures, AFP news agency cited the French interior ministry as saying.

Spain and Italy have introduced rules that mean international arrivals must self-isolate for two weeks, while on Friday Ireland gave further details for its own quarantine proposals. AIRLINES DISMAYED The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said the blanket quarantine was deeply concerning and could be avoided with strong safety measures. “This approach will damage international business and investor confidence at a time when it is vital to demonstrate that the UK can open for business safely,” BCC Director General Adam Marshall said. The opposition Labour Party supported the measures but said the government’s handling of UK arrivals had “lacked urgency, coherence and clarity from the outset”. Some members of Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative party have also criticised the plan. Chief among industry critics are airline bosses, who have said the measures would have severe repercussions. Michael O’Leary, Ryanair’s chief executive, said they would be “unenforceable and unpoliceable.”  Slideshow (6 Images)Ryanair and easyJet have outlined plans to restart some flights in coming months. But under the quarantine plan, Virgin Atlantic will not restart until August at the earliest. “Introducing a quarantine at this stage makes no sense and will mean very limited international aviation at best,” said Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines UK. “It is just about the worst thing government could do if their aim is to restart the economy.” Additional reporting by Estelle Shirbon, Guy Faulconbridge and Kate Holton; editing by Michael Holden, Stephen Addison and Leslie AdlerOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

"June 17, 2020",BCC,"                Families sleep in water lines as drought grips Zimbabwe's Bulawayo - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Big Story 10June 17, 2020 /  2:08 AM / a month agoFamilies sleep in water lines as drought grips Zimbabwe's BulawayoLungelo Ndhlovu7 Min ReadBULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Twice a week, Nothi Mlalazi joins a long line with dozens of other people - some of whom have slept there overnight - and stands for hours waiting for water in Zimbabwe’s second-largest city. As the parched southern African country endures its worst drought in years - a problem scientists link to climate change - ongoing water shortages in Bulawayo have left residents in some suburbs without running water for more than three months. The tankers that the city council sends to deliver water every few days are often the residents’ only hope for clean water.  Many will spend the night at the delivery point to make sure they can fill their buckets before the tankers - or bowsers - run dry.  “Receiving water from bowsers is a huge challenge for many residents. We spend most of our time in long, winding queues, impatiently waiting to fill up our containers,” said Mlalazi, 45, who lives in the poor, crowded suburb of Pumula South. “You will find (people) as early as 1 a.m. already there,” she added, as she stood in line with two of her daughters, who watched to make sure nobody stole their water buckets. LOW RESERVES After several years of drought and patchy rains, reservoir levels have fallen dangerously low, pushing the Bulawayo City Council (BCC) to limit water supplies in an attempt to conserve the resource until the rainy season starts in October.  Last month, city authorities began shutting off piped water six days a week, reporting that the three dams acting as the city’s primary water sources were at less than 30% of capacity.  The city had already decommissioned three other dams due to the water dropping below pumping levels.  Some residents have resorted to drawing the water they need for washing from unprotected sources such as ponds and leaking water pipes, or tapping into sewage gutters for water to flush their toilets, said Pumula South resident Charles Siziba. Siziba said the situation is made even more dire by the coronavirus pandemic, as the lack of running water increases the risk that people will catch the illness and infect others. It is almost impossible to practice the regular handwashing that health experts say is one of the best weapons against the virus, he noted. “And there is also no social distancing to speak of, because when the bowser comes through, residents push and shove in the water queue to fill up their buckets,” Siziba said. CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE Many central and western parts of southern Africa - including Zimbabwe - have experienced their lowest rainfall since 1981 over the past year, according to the United Nations. Attributing the low reservoir levels to back-to-back droughts since 2018, Bulawayo Mayor Solomon Mguni compared the city’s struggles to those during a devastating dry period in the early 1990s. “The city’s water situation is almost a recurrence of the 1992 situation where the city experienced a crippling drought that affected the city’s raw water storage and supply,” he said in a June statement. Mguni added that the city council had made repeated appeals to Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing for Bulawayo to be officially declared a water shortage area, which would channel resources toward rehabilitating the city’s water infrastructure. In April, an independent engineering consultant hired by the ministry concluded that Bulawayo’s dams had enough water to last 14 months and that a crumbling water supply system is to blame for the shortages. Local officials disputed the findings, saying the water shortages were not solely an infrastructure problem. More than 30% of the water running through the city’s pipes leaks out before it reaches consumers, city council spokeswoman Nesisa Mpofu told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  Even on the one day of the week that the water is turned on in Mlalazi’s section of the city, she and her neighbours still find their taps run dry, as the water network struggles to get the resource up to their homes on higher ground. Simela Dube, the director of engineering services at the city council, confirmed to the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview that some residents don’t get any water at all because of low pressure in the city’s pumping systems.  “When pressure is low in our reservoirs, it doesn’t flow into high-elevated areas,” he said. “Because of this situation, bowsers are dispatched to those areas that don’t get water.” WATER KIOSKS But the water tankers are not always reliable, say local residents and authorities. Sichelesile Mahlangu, a member of parliament for Pumula constituency, said she recently met some residents who had been in line for 12 hours waiting for drivers to dispense water. To ease the situation, Dube, the water engineer, said the council has started the process of installing 10,000-litre “water-tank kiosks” in 25 sites where more than 6,000 homes are in need of emergency water supplies.  The kiosks, which cost $4,500 each, consist of a large tank with multiple taps. The bowsers fill the tanks each week and residents can collect water at any time of day, cutting down on queuing times.  According to Mpofu, the council spokeswoman, one kiosk has already been installed in the Pumula East suburb and the city has identified sites for six more so far. Last month, Thabo Siziba, a Zimbabwean real estate investor based in Canada, launched a campaign using the online fundraiser GoFundMe to try to gather $15,000 to build at least two of those water kiosks.   The campaign has raised more than $4,000 so far.  In Pumula South, resident Nelson Mande Lunga told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that he stopped getting running water in his home weeks before the city started limiting water supplies to one day a week. “I have resorted to asking for water from my neighbours who can get water on low pressure,” he said.  “Otherwise, I also rely on my friends who fill up my water containers from town,” Lunga lamented as he stood next to his seven buckets in a long queue for the water tanker.

FILE PHOTO: Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak attends a news conference on the ongoing situation with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in London, Britain, March 17, 2020. Matt Dunham/Pool via REUTERSThe British Chambers of Commerce said on Wednesday its quarterly survey of 7,700 firms found the share of companies reporting growth in sales was far below even the low point of the global financial crisis of 2007-08. “Our results demonstrate the need for swift and substantial action,” the BCC’s director general Adam Marshall said. “The UK cannot meander its way back to success in this era of uncertainty.”  Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised on Tuesday to fast-track infrastructure investment and slash property planning rules. The spending announcement of 5 billion pounds ($6.2 billion) amounted to around 5% of gross public sector investment last year, most of which had already been announced. Sunak is due to announce more details of the government’s plans next week, on top of the 133 billion pounds of emergency measures he has rushed out mostly to keep people in their jobs.  However, Sunak has so far opted not to bring forward a major budget statement which is due in the autumn. The BCC said its survey showed orders and investment intentions at record lows for services firms and manufacturers.  Marshall called on the government to cut employers’ social security contributions and take other measures to help companies keep workers on their books after Britain’s huge state furlough scheme expires at the end of October. Companies would need extra investment incentives and help to survive cashflow crunches in the form of wider relief from property taxes and more grants. The government should also take measures to stimulate consumer demand, Marshall said. ($1 = 0.8129 pounds) (This story fixes dropped letter in British Chambers of Commerce.)

"April 28, 2020",BCC,"                UK small firms use furlough scheme to avoid permanent job cuts: BCC - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsApril 28, 2020 /  11:07 PM / 3 months agoUK small firms use furlough scheme to avoid permanent job cuts: BCC3 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Three of every four small British businesses have temporarily laid off staff using an emergency government scheme to pay their wages, minimising permanent job losses during the coronavirus lockdown so far, a survey published on Wednesday showed. The British Chambers of Commerce said 76% of member firms it surveyed had furloughed some of their staff under the wage-guarantee scheme, up from 71% a week earlier, and almost none had made staff permanently redundant.      BCC Director-General Adam Marshall said the plan was an essential part of supporting businesses through the crisis and needed to be extended. “While the furlough scheme cannot be indefinite, it will need to run well beyond June 30 in some form to help businesses transition toward a ‘new normal’ as the lockdown is eased,” he said in a statement Finance minister Rishi Sunak said on Monday that half a million firms had made claims in the first week of the job retention scheme, covering more than 4 million jobs at a cost of 4.5 billion pounds ($5.6 billion) to the public finances. In another survey released on Wednesday, the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development - whose members typically work at somewhat larger employers than the BCC - said 46% of firms had furloughed staff, and another 10% planned to do so. However it criticised the scheme for not allowing firms to reduce staff hours, rather than furlough them completely. The all-or-nothing approach to furlough would also make it harder to bring back staff gradually as social distancing measures are lifted, CIPD chief executive Peter Cheese said. “This will be vital as lockdown measures are eased over a number of weeks or months, and will reduce the risk of large-scale redundancies in this next phase of the crisis,” he said. As well as the jobs retention scheme, Britain’s government has launched state-backed loan programmes which have been slow to gain momentum. The BCC said 57% of the firms in its survey did not intend to apply for the main emergency credit scheme and only one in eight of those which did apply had received money so far. The proportion reporting success in the BCC survey is far lower than the average in the latest data from Britain’s banks, which showed about 45% of applicants have had loans approved. Sunak said on Monday he would launch a new scheme offering fully state-backed loans of up to 50,000 pounds ($62,000) to the smallest businesses, up from 80% support for the other emergency loan programmes for bigger firms. “Loan support has not been getting to businesses fast enough, so this week’s announcement of the Bounce Back loan scheme and further improvements to the CBILS scheme are welcome steps,” the BCC’s Marshall said.

Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS/Axel SchmidtThe posts make the claim that “Ovid” means sheep in Latin, the “C” means “to see” in an unspecified “ancient language” and that 19 was the so-called “number of surrender” in “ancient times”. Some examples of the claim are visible  here  ,  here  and  here  . “OVID” The word for “sheep” in Latin in is “ovis”, not “ovid” (  here  ). In the English-speaking world, Ovid often refers to Publius Ovidius Naso, a Roman poet who lived in the 1st century BCE (  here  ). It is possible that the name Ovidius is derived from the Latin word ovis (  en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ovidius  ). “C” The stand-alone letter “C” does not refer to the verb “to see” in an “ancient language”, which one original poster clarifies as “Latin and Roman (sic)” in a comment (  here  ). “Cf” is an abbreviation for the Latin word confer, often used in endnotes or footnotes to point the reader to works that offer an argument which contradicts or is otherwise different from the author’s argument, according to the Writing Center at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (  here  ). It is unclear what exactly is meant by the post. NUMBER 19 According to the Encyclopedia Britannica’s entry on number symbology, the number 19 was considered unlucky for ancient Babylonians, while in Islamic numerology, the number could be considered “an important name for God” (  here  ). No search results that point to the number’s significance cite historical evidence to demonstrate that it was indeed considered the “number of surrender” by any ancient civilization (  here  ). 19 is used as a mystical number by Stephen King, making appearances in multiple books in his Dark Tower series (  stephenking.fandom.com/wiki/19  ). COVID-19 The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) gives viruses their names according to their genetic structure and for the benefit of scientific research. It named the virus responsible for COVID-19 as SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) on February 11, 2020, due to its genetic relation to SARS. ​ The term COVID-19 refers to “coronavirus disease 2019"" (  bit.ly/2BsurLU  ). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explains on its website: “The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.” (  here  ) VERDICT False. COVID-19 does not mean “see a sheep surrender”, it stands for “coronavirus disease 2019”.

Tirando para arriba del Ibex-35, Repsol acabó con un alza del 13,2011% tras la publicación de sus resultados del primer trimestre, ya que pese a haber registrado una caída del 28% en el beneficio, superó las expectativas del mercado. Así y todo, la petrolera advirtió que le resulta complicado predecir en qué medida y por cuánto tiempo afectará al negocio la pandemia, que sumada a la disputa entre Arabia Saudita y Rusia y las preocupaciones sobre el exceso de demanda ya ha causado una devaluación del crudo del 65% entre enero y  marzo. En el plano económico, el Tribunal Constitucional de Alemania falló el martes que el Bundesbank debe dejar de comprar deuda soberana bajo el plan de estímulo a largo plazo del Banco Central Europeo dentro de los próximos tres meses a menos que el prestamista europeo pueda probar que tales compras son necesarias. La decisión asesta un duro golpe a un programa de compras del BCE clave para la zona euro durante varias crisis y planteando la perspectiva de un nuevo conflicto con su mayor partícipe. En clave doméstica, los datos de paro registrado de abril mostraron otra fuerte destrucción de empleo por las medidas de confinamiento en España contra la crisis sanitaria, al tiempo que la cifra de beneficiarios de prestaciones por desempleo alcanzó un récord de casi 5,2 millones al sumar los despidos temporales aplicados a cientos de miles de trabajadores. Así las cosas, el Ibex-35 acabó con una subida del 1,11%, hasta los 6.747,7 puntos. En el sector bancario predominaron las ganancias: Santander se anotó un 1,6127%, BBVA cerró plano, Caixabank se revalorizó un 0,0627%, Bankia se apuntó un 1,2169% y Sabadell fue el único que cerró con una pérdida del 1,9274%. Entre los grandes valores no financieros, Telefónica se anotó un 1,8842%, Inditex ganó un 0,6897% e Iberdrola subió un 0,2012%. En el extremo inferior de la tabla destacó el holding de aerolíneas angloespañol IAG, uno de los valores que más están padeciendo las consecuencias de la crisis sanitaria, que acabó con una caída del 3,8789%.

"June 3, 2020",BCE,"                Ericsson shares boosted after 5G contract win in Canada, beating Huawei - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Hot StocksJune 3, 2020 /  11:07 AM / 2 months agoEricsson shares boosted after 5G contract win in Canada, beating HuaweiSupantha Mukherjee3 Min ReadJune 3 (Reuters) - Ericsson shares hit a high for the year after the Swedish telecom equipment maker increased its footprint in Canada by winning a 5G contract from Bell Canada, beating out China’s Huawei. Bell Canada, part of BCE Corp, had relied on Huawei for deploying 4G infrastructure but went with Ericsson as Canada was deliberating whether to allow Huawei to sell 5G equipment in the country. The United States has raised security concerns about Huawei and has warned that allies that use its equipment in their networks risked being cut off from valuable intelligence sharing. Huawei has repeatedly denied the U.S. allegations. The contract win, Ericsson’s 93rd for the next generation equipment, will significantly expand the company’s market share with Bell compared to 4G, an Ericsson spokesman said. He declined to give the value of the contract. Ericsson had earlier signed one of Canada’s largest wireless carriers, Rogers Communications, as a 5G customer. Chief Executive Borje Ekholm has driven a turnaround at Ericsson during his three years at the helm, improving profit margins amid growing demand 5G upgrades. While choosing Ericsson removes vendor uncertainty over deploying 5G, it might increase Bell Canada’s operating costs as switching vendors and swapping out equipment takes several years to finalise. Bell Canada, Canada’s second-largest cellphone provider by wireless revenue, would have to spend about $200 million over the next few years to swap out Huawei gear, Scotiabank analyst Jeff Fan said. Ericsson, along with Nordic rival Nokia, also secured a contract from Telus Corp to sell 5G core products. Telus, another Huawei 4G customer, is yet to choose a vendor for 5G radio access network (RAN). “Size and scale of RAN components are much bigger in any network, so it will be more costly to replace RAN,” Credit Suisse analyst Achal Sultania said. Ericsson shares were trading at 89.02 Swedish krona by 1045 GMT, off earlier highs but up by 1.8%.

Tras haber pasado por el pico de infecciones de la pandemia, los Gobiernos de Europa han empezado a relajar los confinamientos e instan a retomar la actividad comercial, lo que a su vez impulsaba al petróleo ante las expectativas de que la demanda de combustible repunte. No obstante, el riesgo de una nueva oleada de coronavirus y de una nueva guerra comercial entre EEUU y China invitaban a la prudencia, en un contexto de incertidumbre por el sombrío panorama económico. Además, los mercados estarán pendientes de la decisión del Tribunal Constitucional Alemán sobre si el Bundesbank puede comprar deuda dentro del programa de compra de deuda del BCE, según recuerdan analistas de la casa de valores Renta 4. En plena temporada de resultados corporativos, el Ibex-35 subía un 1,85%, hasta los 6.796,9 puntos, mientras el índice de grandes valores europeos FTSE Eurofirst 300 retrocedía 33,68 puntos o un 2,56%, a 1.284,39. En el sector bancario acogía la jornada con ganancias: Santander se anotaba un 3,1183%, mientras BBVA subía un 3,3929%, Caixabank se revalorizaba un 2,7586%, Bankia se apuntaba un 2,173% y Sabadell subía un 2,4943%. La petrolera Repsol se apuntaba un 7,7485% tras comunicar un resultado neto ajustado de 447 millones de euros en el primer trimestre del año, un 28% inferior al del mismo periodo de 2019, en un contexto de acentuada caída del precio del crudo y de reducción de la demanda por la pandemia de COVID-19. La eléctrica Endesa también se situaba en lo alto de la tabla con una subida del 4,859% tras informar el lunes que aumentó un 60% su ebitda en el primer trimestre, con un impacto limitado de la crisis sanitaria. Entre los grandes valores no financieros, Telefónica se anotaba un 2,2098%, Inditex ganaba un 1,6092% e Iberdrola subía un 0,626%. La empresa de hemoderivados Grifols, de carácter defensivo, caía un 1,095%, por debajo de Amadeus que cedía otro 0,024%.

"May 5, 2020",BCE,"                La fuerte subida de Repsol devuelve el aliento al Ibex-35 - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States BiotechnologyMay 5, 2020 /  5:01 PM / 3 months agoLa fuerte subida de Repsol devuelve el aliento al Ibex-353 Min Read5 may (Reuters) - El principal selectivo español cerró la sesión del martes en positivo impulsado sobre todo por la fuerte subida de Repsol, en un día marcado por la decisión del Constitucional alemán sobre un programa de compra de deuda pública del BCE. Tirando para arriba del Ibex-35, Repsol acabó con un alza del 13,2011% tras la publicación de sus resultados del primer trimestre, ya que pese a haber registrado una caída del 28% en el beneficio, superó las expectativas del mercado. Así y con todo, la petrolera advirtió que le resulta complicado predecir en qué medida y durante cuánto tiempo afectará al negocio la pandemia, que sumada al efecto de la disputa entre Arabia Saudí y Rusia y las preocupaciones sobre el exceso de demanda ya ha causado una devaluación del crudo del 65% entre enero y  marzo. En el plano económico, el Tribunal Constitucional de Alemania falló el martes que el Bundesbank debe dejar de comprar deuda soberana bajo el plan de estímulo a largo plazo del Banco Central Europeo dentro de los próximos tres meses a menos que el prestamista europeo pueda probar que tales compras son necesarias. La decisión asesta un duro golpe a un programa de compras del BCE clave para la zona euro durante varias crisis y planteando la perspectiva de un nuevo conflicto con su mayor partícipe. En clave doméstica, los datos de paro registrado de abril mostraron otra fuerte destrucción de empleo por las medidas de confinamiento en España contra la crisis sanitaria, al tiempo que la cifra de beneficiarios de prestaciones por desempleo alcanzó un récord de casi 5,2 millones al sumar los despidos temporales aplicados a cientos de miles de trabajadores. Así las cosas, el Ibex-35 acabó con una subida del 1,11%, hasta los 6.747,7 puntos. En el sector bancario predominaron las ganancias: Santander se anotó un 1,6127%, BBVA cerró plano, Caixabank se revalorizó un 0,0627%, Bankia se apuntó un 1,2169% y Sabadell fue el único que cerró con una pérdida del 1,9274%. Entre los grandes valores no financieros, Telefónica se anotó un 1,8842%, Inditex ganó un 0,6897% e Iberdrola subió un 0,2012%. En el extremo inferior de la tabla destacó el holding de aerolíneas angloespañol IAG, uno de los valores que más están padeciendo las consecuencias de la crisis sanitaria, que acabó con una caída del 3,8789%.

"June 11, 2020",BCS,"                Big rate cut no quick fix for Russian economy - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsJune 11, 2020 /  6:55 AM / a month agoBig rate cut no quick fix for Russian economyAlexander Marrow5 Min ReadMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s central bank has signalled it may cut its benchmark rate next week to the lowest since the collapse of the Soviet Union but even that would only have a limited direct impact on the economy’s post-pandemic recovery, analysts say.     FILE PHOTO: Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina attends a news conference in Moscow, Russia March 22, 2019. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov With its benchmark rate at 5.5%, the Bank of Russia has far more leeway to cut than counterparts in major Western economies where rates are already close to zero or even negative.  But analysts doubt whether even a 100 basis point cut would result in a jump in the broad-based borrowing needed to get the economy going, with gross domestic product expected to shrink by up to 6% this year because of the fallout from the coronavirus.     “There’s not much possibility for the population to take on more debt because of the cap on real income growth and there’s not much demand from the real economy from businesses,” said Vladimir Tikhomirov, chief economist at BCS Global Markets. Governor Elvira Nabiullina has hinted at a 100 basis point cut on June 19, which would be the biggest single reduction since June 2015. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast a 50 basis point cut, with further easing by the end of the year. It’s a far cry from the Russian crises of 2008/09 and 2014/15 when a toxic combination of economic contraction and booming inflation forced the central bank to push rates sharply higher in a bid to support the rouble.  This time inflation is just 3% and real disposable incomes are now projected to shrink by 3.8% in 2020, rather than growing by 1.9% as previously expected, according to the economy ministry.      “The carry-on effect of the rate cut to the economy is likely to be very marginal, very, very small. It won’t be a game-changer for the economy at large,” said Tikhomirov, questioning whether banks would even pass on the cut to customers as their profits had been hit by the pandemic. BOOST FOR PUTIN PROJECTS?     The central bank’s credibility has grown over the past few years under Nabiullina. A year after she become governor in 2013, the bank went through a torrid time and had to raise its key rate by 650 basis points to 17% in December 2014 to rescue the rouble, just after adopting a free-floating currency regime. That year, the bank burned through nearly $80 billion to prop up a currency hit by weak oil prices, Western sanctions against Russia over the annexation of Crimea and the impact of companies needing to repay debt denominated in foreign currency. But interest rates have been on a generally downward trajectory ever since and the central bank cut its key rate by 50 basis points in April to the lowest since the start of 2014. A 100 basis point cut next week would take it down to 4.5%, which would be lowest since the collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991. Nevertheless, Dmitry Polevoy, chief economist at the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said a move to a policy of bigger cuts would not have an immediate impact as it takes time for changes in monetary policy to filter through to the real economy. Even cheap loan schemes that have been made available by the government and banks to cushion the fallout from the pandemic have failed to dramatically stimulate spending so far, analysts say.     A policy shift to bigger rate cuts is also not without risks. It could backfire if inflation starts to accelerate faster than forecast, said Ivan Tchakarov, chief economist at Citi for Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.

REUTERS/Shamil ZhumatovLower rates could also hit the rouble and lead to more modest returns on governments bonds, or OFZs, which have been snapped up by foreign investors but are already becoming less attractive because of recent rate cuts. One significant benefit of a cut, however, would be to make cheaper money available to the state as it emerges from its lockdown and President Vladimir Putin pushes ahead with $400 billion of economic and social spending on national projects.     “It is money, it is blood for the economy,” Yury Borisov, a deputy prime minister, said last month of the expected rate cut.

"June 11, 2020",BCS,"                Russia's BCS Global Markets brokerage still aims for 2023 IPO - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States DealsJune 11, 2020 /  11:48 AM / a month agoRussia's BCS Global Markets brokerage still aims for 2023 IPO2 Min ReadMOSCOW (Reuters) - BCS Global Markets, the investment banking division of Russia’s BCS Financial Group, is pushing ahead with plans for an initial public offering in 2023, but it said on Thursday it would not disclose major details at this early stage. BCS is one of the largest brokerages in Russia, which has seen massive private investment inflow to its stock markets in the past two years as bank deposit rates declined during a period of central bank monetary easing.  The number of private investors could reach 7 million by the end of the year, according to analysts at Promsvyazbank, while the Moscow Exchange saw a surge in retail investors in March. The group’s strategy is to achieve a $1 billion valuation for BCS Global Markets by the end of 2022, before going public, according to an article by the daily Kommersant in December 2019.  BCS Global Markets on Thursday told Reuters it was too early to talk about any details and configurations of the deal.  “The new strategy also depends in large part on external factors, which now regularly demonstrate their unpredictable nature,” BCS Global Markets CEO Alexei Gonus told Reuters.

An undated photo provided by the Greek Culture Ministry on June 10, 2020, shows an 8th century B.C. horse figurine of the Ancient Greek Geometric period. Greek Culture Ministry/Handout via REUTERS Lina Mendoni said Tuesday’s ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had set a precedent and recognised countries’ sovereign right to call for the return of artefacts. However the court has left unresolved the fundamental issue of who owns the horse. The Greek government wrote to Sotheby’s auction house in 2018 asking it to stop a sale of the 8th century BC statue, saying it was Greek national property, according to the text of the appeals court ruling. Later that year, Sotheby’s and descendants of art collectors Howard and Saretta Barnet took the unusual step of suing the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports in the U.S. courts, seeking a declaration that the family owned the horse and that Sotheby’s could sell it.  A year later, a US judge rejected Greece’s effort to dismiss that lawsuit. But the appeal court ruled on Tuesday that Greece had been pursuing its sovereign rights, not commercial interests, when making the claim. So under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, Greece could not face such a lawsuit. The appeals court did not rule on who owned the statue.  Culture Minister Mendoni told Reuters TV: “Greece has clearly achieved a huge victory - a legal precedent, a judicial precedent, has already been created, and through Greece, it favours all countries from which cultural goods are illegally exported. “In the same decision, it is recognised that the claiming of cultural rights by a country, by Greece in this case, concerns a sovereign issue, an issue of sovereign rights. This is very, very important,” she added.  Sotheby’s said on Wednesday it was disappointed by the ruling. “There is, and remains, no evidence to support Greece’s claim to ownership of the bronze sculpture. We, together with our client, are reviewing next steps,” it said. Greece has been waging campaigns for decades for the repatriation of antiquities it says have been stolen or illegally excavated.  Its biggest is for the return of the Parthenon Marbles which are on display in the British Museum in London. The British Museum says the marbles were acquired legally.

The people were charged in connection with a 3.5 billion euro ($3.9 billion) special dividend that Seat Pagine Gialle paid in 2004, increasing its debt to 4 billion euros at the end of that year. The company, which was bought by BC Partners, CVC, Investitori Associati and Permira in 2003, never managed to shake off the burden of that indebtedness. It was eventually placed under a court restructuring, similar to Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, in 2013, before being taken over in 2015 by Italiaonline, an Internet company controlled by Egyptian businessman Naguib Sawiris.

Richard Cobb, 29, is due to be put to death by lethal injection after 6 p.m. CDT (2300 GMT) at a state prison in Huntsville. He would be the fourth person executed in Texas this year and the ninth in the United States, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Cobb and his accomplice, Beunka Adams, who was executed in 2012 for the crime, entered BDJ’s convenience store in Rusk, Texas, armed with a shotgun and wearing masks and demanded money, according to an account of the case from the state attorney general’s office. Cobb and Adams took store clerks Candace Driver and Nikki Ansley Dement hostage along with customer Kenneth Vandever and forced them into Driver’s Cadillac, then Adams drove to an open pasture, the account said. Adams forced Driver and Vandever into the trunk while Cobb held the gun. Then, Adams took Dement to a wooded area and raped her. Later, according to the account, Cobb fatally shot Vandever and either Cobb or Adams shot the two women, who survived. “Mr. Cobb has never disputed his involvement in the crimes, but explained that he acted out of fear of Adams, who orchestrated the crimes,” says a statement of the case that is included in a court filing by Cobb’s lawyer. Cobb, who was 18 at the time of the kidnapping murder, has appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that his death sentence was based on false testimony by a state witness.

"October 27, 2016",BDJ,"                Davis scores 50, but Pelicans fall to Nuggets - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States IntelOctober 27, 2016 /  3:12 AM / 4 years agoDavis scores 50, but Pelicans fall to Nuggets5 Min ReadDavis scores 50, but Pelicans fall to Nuggets NEW ORLEANS — It was not exactly five on one, but it was about as close to that as a playground game of keep-away. Despite a monster 50-point performance by New Orleans Pelicans forward Anthony Davis, the Denver Nuggets suffocated Davis’ teammates to secure a 107-102 victory in the season opener Wednesday night at the Smoothie King Center. “When you play against a great player, you have a problem you need to answer: Are you going to shut him down and create problems elsewhere or are you going to let him get his and hope nobody else goes off?” Denver coach Mike Malone said. “Anthony Davis give him credit got 50 points. The Denver Nuggets got the win, and that’s the most important thing.” Davis’ 50-point performance was only the third such performance in a season opener since the 1963-64 season. The other two belonged to a guy named Michael Jordan. “It’s tough,” Davis said. “We had some chances, but we gave them too many easy looks at the beginning of the game. It would have been more satisfying if we had won, but the way I played, I’m going to have to bring, probably not 50 every night, but get somewhere along those lines every game to give ourselves a chance to win. That’s the bottom line. I just got to keep finding guys and trust those guys that they’re going to make shots.” The imbalance in the Pelicans offense — one that is missing guards Jrue Holiday and Tyreke Evans — was striking. The four other New Orleans starters combined for 29 points and eight rebounds. Davis aside, the Pelicans went 21 of 58 from the floor (36.2 percent). New Orleans missed 16 of 19 3-point attempts. Davis, meanwhile, had 16 rebounds, seven steals, four blocks and five assists to go with his eighth career 40-plus outing. The Nuggets’ tall lineup of Jusuf Nurkic and Nikola Jokic, along with reserve forward Kenneth Faried, crushed the Pelicans on the boards, 58-34, and Denver used its dominance near the basket to hold a 14-3 edge in second-chance points. Nurkic led Denver with 23 points and guard Will Barton added 22. Barton also pulled down a key offensive rebound on a missed 3-point attempt by Danilo Gallinari to give Denver a 100-94 lead down the stretch. Faried, coming off the bench, steadied the Nuggets in the fourth quarter when the Pelicans cut an eight-point deficit to two. Faried made all three field goal attempts — a short hook, a driving layup and a rebound follow — and grabbed three rebounds and two steals. He also took a pair of charges from Dante Cunningham and Lance Stephenson. “Kenneth Faried off the bench was a difference maker,” Malone said. “I give him a lot of credit because he’s a guy who started his whole career, not feeling sorry for himself, and going out there and finishing the game and helping us get a win. We don’t win the game without Kenneth Faried.” Davis scored his 50 points on 17-of-34 shooting from the field and 16 of 17 free throws. He finished nine short of his career high of 59. “I thought AD played great, did a lot of good things for us,” Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry said. “If they’re going to commit three guys to AD, then we’ve got to have guys step up and make shots. Obviously, we’ve got to try to make enough plays to get over the hump.” Faried said he simply loves doing his job, whether that means starting or coming off the bench. “Just another day at the office, you know,” Faried said. “We were just able to get the win, and that’s all that matters. It’s more exciting to get the win than to worry about my stats.” Davis said he knows he will be required to carry the load until Holiday and Evans get back to provide some offensive firepower.

I’m going to get a good massage tomorrow.” NOTES: Opening night saw an intriguing comparison between two highly regarded rookie prospects — Pelicans G Buddy Hield (sixth overall pick out of Oklahoma) and Nuggets G Jamal Murray (seventh pick out of Kentucky). Hield went 2 of 8 and missed all three 3-pointers. Murray was 0 for 2. “I think it was personal preference,” New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said of the club’s decision to take Hield over Murray. “Jamal, I think, is going to be a really good player, and he was right there on our radar as well. We think both of those guys are going to be great shooters in the league.” ... Nuggets coach Mike Malone said Murray would have been Denver’s pick even if Hield had been available. “It wasn’t close,” Malone said. “I say that with no disrespect to Buddy Hield, because he’s a helluva player. Jamal Murray was identified by our front office early as guy they had very early on.” ... The Pelicans wore T-shirts with a “BDJ 31” logo in memory of Bryce Dejean-Jones, who was fatally shot last May.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

FILE PHOTO - The logo of SIG Combibloc Group, manufacturer of carton packaging and filling machines for beverages and food, is seen at a plant in the town of Neuhausen, Switzerland June 15, 2016.  REUTERS /Arnd WiegmannIts private equity owner Onex (ONEX.TO) has hired Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and Bank of America (BAC.N) as global coordinators for the listing, the sources said. The banks declined to comment while Onex was not immediately available for comment. SIG makes cartons for beverages and food and competes with larger rival Tetra Pak, a unit of Tetra Laval. It is expected to report earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of about 450 million euros this year.  New shares worth up to 1 billion euros may be offered in the flotation, one of the people said, adding that on top of that existing shares worth up to 500 million euros may be sold. The bulk of the proceeds will be used to bring down debt levels from a current 5.5 times EBITDA to about 3.5 times, the person said. Ahead of the listing, Onex will also sound out potential buyers for the firm it bought in 2015 from New Zealand billionaire Graeme Hart in a deal valued at 3.75 billion euros, the person added. A listing may value SIG Combibloc at about 9-10 times its expected core earnings, including debt, in line with rivals including Bery (BERY.N), Ball (BLL.N), Silgan (SLGN.O), Bemis BMS.N or Polyone (POL.N), the sources said.  In an increasingly crowded European equity-raising market, Switzerland is seeing a flurry of stock market listings, including transport firm Ceva Logistics and drugmaker Polyphor announced on Monday. SIG had been listed in Switzerland before as part of the Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG) conglomerate that made everything from juice cartons to passenger trains to weaponry. Its businesses were gradually sold off as the company narrowed its to focus to packaging. Rothschild is acting as an adviser on the IPO, Reuters reported in March.

Rajapaksa, who will be sworn into office in an ancient Buddhist temple on Monday, is the latest nationalist leader to sweep to election victory, tapping into the anger and fears of majority communities. In his first comments after defeating Sajith Premadasa, a housing minister in the current government, Rajapaksa struck a conciliatory note, suggesting he would be leader of all Sri Lankans, regardless of their ethnic and religious identities.    “As we usher in a new journey for Sri Lanka, we must remember that all Sri Lankans are part of this journey. Let us rejoice peacefully, with dignity and discipline in the same manner in which we campaigned,” Rajapaksa said in a tweet.   The election commission said Rajapaksa won 52.25% of the votes in Saturday’s election, while Premadasa got 41.99%, giving Rajapaksa a far bigger lead than predicted by politicians and analysts. Millions voted to elect a new president to lead the country out of its deepest economic slump in over 15 years, dragged down by its tourism sector following the bombings on April 21 which killed more than 250 people.

He has promised strong leadership to secure the island of 22 million people, the majority of whom are Sinhalese Buddhists. Rajapaksa and his brothers, who are expected to get key positions, are seen as closer to China than Premadasa. China has invested billions of dollars building ports, expressways and power stations in the strategic Indian Ocean island nation. But these projects have also led to high debt levels for Sri Lanka. Finance minister Mangala Samaraweera and two other ministers resigned on Sunday after the defeat of the ruling party’s candidate in the election. Tamil political parties are strongly opposed to Rajapaksa, who has faced allegations of widespread human rights violations of civilians in the final stages of the war against the separatists in 2009.  Rajapaksa and his brother deny the allegations.  President-elect Gotabaya Rajapaksa waves at his supporters as he leaves his house in Colombo, Sri Lanka November 17, 2019.

Islamic State claimed responsibility. “His victory shows a division, and this could create more issues specially for other ethnic groups. I don’t know how he will tackle Muslims and Tamils,” said Victor Ivan, a political columnist. PIVOT TO CHINA Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet he looked forward to working with Rajapaksa. Sri Lanka, sitting near shipping lanes in the Indian Ocean, has become an arena of contest between regional heavyweights India and China. Beijing stepped in for post-war reconstruction after the West and India shunned the Rajapaksas because of the allegations of rights violations at the end of the civil war.  Now that the family was returning to power, China will likely be the gainer, said an analyst. “We’re likely to see a pivot toward China once again. China is likely very happy that Gota has won,” said Akhil Bery of the Eurasia group. Slideshow (13 Images)During the campaign, Rajapaksa promised to cut the 15% value added tax by nearly half and abolish some other taxes, as a way to reignite consumption and growth. These cuts could lead to a loss of more than 600 billion rupees ($3.31 billion) in tax revenues, finance ministry officials say, adding to the pressure on public finances at a time when the country is under a $1.5 billion, four-year IMF loan program.

"November 21, 2019",BERY,"                Sri Lanka's ruling siblings: New president swears in his brother as PM - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States World NewsNovember 21, 2019 /  9:42 AM / 8 months agoSri Lanka's ruling siblings: New president swears in his brother as PMShihar Aneez3 Min ReadCOLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka’s newly elected president Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Thursday swore in his elder brother, former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, as prime minister, cementing the powerful family’s political comeback.  Sri Lanka's President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his brother and former leader Mahinda Rajapaksa, who was appointed as the new Prime Minister, shake hands during the swearing in ceremony in Colombo, Sri Lanka November 21, 2019. REUTERS/Dinuka LiyanawatteThe appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa, 74, came hours after the former premier Ranil Wickremesinghe tendered his resignation following the defeat of his party’s candidate in a presidential election to Gotabaya Rajapaksa over the weekend.  It is the first time in Sri Lankan history that two siblings have held the two top political positions, although Mahinda is only in charge of a caretaker government until parliamentary elections next year.  In a ceremony in the capital Colombo on Thursday, Gotabaya swore in his brother as their respective wives, sons and daughters-in-law looked on.  “I wish to congratulate and extend my warmest wishes to Hon Mahinda Rajapaksa, Prime Minister of the Democratic, Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka,” Gotabaya tweeted afterwards.  Gotabaya, 70, had earlier served as defense chief under his brother Mahinda, who himself served as president from 2005-2015. Mahinda, who had been Sri Lanka’s opposition leader since January, has held the prime minister’s post twice before. He is set to be his party’s candidate in a parliamentary election expected around April. The former president, popular with the Sinhalese majority for overseeing the end of a 26-year long civil war, is broadly seen as a shoo-in.  “The Rajapaksa brand, as evidenced by the election, remains extremely strong,” said Akhil Bery, Eurasia’s South Asia analyst, adding that Mahinda is perceived to be even more popular than his younger brother.  The siblings face a tall order to revive Sri Lanka’s economy, which is in its deepest slump in nearly two decades following Easter Sunday Islamist attacks that killed over 250 people in churches and hotels. That hurt the rupee and the all-important tourism sector.  Gotabaya, who oversaw the defeat of Tamil separatists as his brother’s defense chief a decade ago, won the election after promising to secure the country against militant threats. His economic manifesto targets average growth of at least 6.5%, compared with 3.2% in 2018, but economists are worried his plans may strain coffers. Managing a record $3 billion in annual external debt repayments over the next five years will be another challenge.  Some investors see Rajapaksa as an experienced hand who will bring political stability to the island. Sri Lanka’s stock index and rupee currency have gained 1.9% and 0.5% respectively since his election.  Rights groups and minorities, however, accuse the Rajapaksas of human rights violations during the war and have expressed concerns of renewed ethnic tensions following the elections. The brothers have denied wrongdoing.

"November 27, 2019",BERY,"                In rain-short Niger, wasps deployed in war on crop-munching worm - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Big Story 10November 27, 2019 /  11:15 AM / 8 months agoIn rain-short Niger, wasps deployed in war on crop-munching wormSebastien Malo6 Min ReadBORGO BERI, Niger (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -  In the West African country of Niger, millet is said to be the king of grains - the cereal crop preferred by all farmers. And the king of millet in the southern town of Borgo Beri is indisputably farmer Hassane Hima. Given the title by his peers, a tradition in Niger, he wears it with pride. “Millet is what people grow most,” he said. But two years ago, Hima’s supremacy was threatened when a minuscule worm began chomping on the area’s millet fields with a giant appetite. The caterpillar, known as the “millet head miner”, is an old foe in this part of the world. But observers say it may have proliferated over the last few years due to increasingly common droughts tied to climate change. In response, residents of Borgo Beri and other villages listened and set to work when global aid agency Catholic Relief Services (CRS) proposed a solution they had not heard of. The method, dating from 1997, is simple enough: the minute Habrobracon hebetor wasp, a natural enemy of the millet worm, is released and lays its eggs on the caterpillar, which is devoured once the wasps hatch.  It is making a fast comeback as the millet head miner threat has grown, with this project and at least one other led by local non-profit Union Haraybane Tera Mooriben supplementing government efforts to grow and spread the wasp. Chemical alternatives to fight off the pest exist but are inefficient and costly, said Madougou Garba, who heads insect studies at Niger’s General Directorate of Plant Protection. Each year, more than 2 million hectares (5 million acres) of millet crops nationwide are vulnerable to the pest, said Garba. ‘FRIGHTENING’ Hima keeps his prized millet crop within earshot - his 6 hectares face his sizeable walled-off adobe home where 13 mouths - two wives and 11 children - depend on the harvest to put food in their stomachs. But a poor rainy season made 2017 a particularly good year for the pest, said Salifou Ousmane, head of agriculture for the department of Balleyara, which covers Borgo Beri. “It signals to this caterpillar, ‘I’ve got to start working, I’ve got to start thinking about preparing for posterity’,” he said. For millet king Hima, 57, it was frightening.   His harvest plummeted from as much as 2,750 kg (6,000 lb) of millet to 550 kg. The proud farmer had to sell nearly all his sheep and cows to buy a season’s worth of the grain, typically imported from neighboring Benin. It is “very likely” that intensifying droughts could explain the pests’ propagation, the two being typically tied in the region, said Amadou Mahamadou Laouali, an agronomist at CRS who said he was not aware of any studies on the topic. In Balleyara, precipitation has halved since the 1980s, according to local authorities.     LOCAL LABORATORY Villagers recall seeing the moths the caterpillars turn into everywhere in 2017 when the pest struck.      Had it touched another local crop, moringa, that year, “we could have died”, said Aissa Bale Bale, a 70-year-old farmer who has bitter memories of the worm’s recent binge. All her nine children lost weight that year from having to ration food, she said. And she would have gone through the same ordeal this year had it not been for Ousseini Soumana, her 51-year-old neighbor, she said. Soumana is all smiles, but he has been waging a ruthless biological war on the millet head miner this year. He is among 69 farmers CRS trained under a British government-funded program called Building Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Extremes and Disasters (BRACED).      In an adobe shack, he showed off with the confidence of a chemist his high-tech kit - petri dishes, test tubes and a Swiss-made folding magnifier - with which he bred his first army of Habrobracon hebetor wasps this year. Nigerien authorities provide the insect free of charge for millet farmers, said Ousmane, agriculture director for Balleyara department, but going through the administrative process to get it delivered means it sometimes arrives late. The BRACED project aimed to help farmers in this village and another 20 breed the caterpillar-munching wasps and sell them in ready-to-deploy jute bags, as a way to supplement their income and protect their communities. Each bag can rid millet fields of the head miner within a radius of 3 to 6 miles (5 to 10 km). But farmers were trained only once in each target village, resulting in just one site successfully breeding enough wasps to sell to others, said Ibrahim Bakoye, another CRS agronomist.  BRACED, working with government officials, also distributed about 1,500 wasp bags since 2017, before the multi-country, $180-million program ended in September, he said. “That is a bit the problem,” he added. “Generally what happens is that just when people start generating something, the project ends.” In his damp office, Ousmane said governments understand aid programs do not continue indefinitely. But now farmers “will have fewer resources”, he said. In Borgo Beri, which has bred only enough wasps for its own use so far, Soumana saw the start of a new era for his community which through him knows how to cure the millet malaise.  “God willing, I will continue the work,” he said. As for his role in keeping millet king Hima on his throne by safeguarding this year’s harvest, “he owes me”, quipped Soumana. Reporting by Sebastien Malo @sebastienmalo; editing by Megan Rowling.

FILE PHOTO - The logo of SIG Combibloc Group, manufacturer of carton packaging and filling machines for beverages and food, is seen at a plant in the town of Neuhausen, Switzerland June 15, 2016.  REUTERS /Arnd Wiegmann Its private equity owner Onex (ONEX.TO) has hired Rothschild (ROTH.PA) as an IPO adviser, and other investment banks have also been contacted regarding their interest in helping organize a potential deal, the sources said. A spokesman said SIG did not comment on speculation about its capital market plans. Rothschild declined to comment, while Onex was not immediately available for comment. SIG makes cartons for beverages and food and competes with larger rival Tetra Pak, a unit of Tetra Laval. It is expected to post earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of about 450 million euros this year.  A listing may value the company at 9-10 times that, including debt, in line with other peers including Bery (BERY.N), Ball (BLL.N), Silgan (SLGN.O), Bemis BMS.N or Polyone (POL.N), the sources said.  Onex bought SIG in 2015 from New Zealand billionaire Graeme Hart in a deal valued at 3.75 billion euros ($4.62 billion) that left the Canadian private equity company and SIG’s management as 100 percent owners. In an increasingly crowded European equity raising market, Switzerland is seeing a flurry of stock market listings, including medical devices maker Medartis and sensor maker Sensirion announced this week.   Rothschild is also working on the Zurich IPO of cargo handler Swissport and, on an as yet unspecified exchange, the listing of logistics firm Ceva, sources have said. SIG had been listed in Switzerland before as part of the Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft (SIG) conglomerate that made everything from juice cartons and passenger trains and military weapons. Its businesses were gradually sold off as the company trimmed its focus to packaging. At the time of Onex’s purchase in 2015, the firm had seven production facilities across Europe, South America and Asia Pacific. It currently employs than 5,000 people at about 40 locations around the world.

Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena walks inside the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China May 15, 2019. REUTERS/Jason Lee/PoolOn Monday last week, just as anti-Muslim riots were spreading in apparent reprisal for the attacks, Sirisena embarked on a three-day trip to key financier China, leaving some Sri Lankans feeling abandoned.  Going ahead with his son’s wedding on May 9 also struck some as an affront to families still in mourning after the April 21 bombings, claimed by Islamic State, which struck churches and hotels.  That leaves Sirisena in a weak position ahead of this year’s presidential election, voters and analysts say, potentially paving the way for former wartime defense chief Gotabaya Rajapaksa to take over.  Sirisena’s allies say he did the best he could in a volatile situation, citing measures like temporarily shutting down social media and deploying the army to stem violence in the multi-ethnic, Buddhist-majority island.  But that rings hollow to voters like 56-year-old construction worker Sunil, who voted for Sirisena in 2015 amid hopes the career politician would combat corruption but now feels the president has not focused on governing.  “The president has no time for this because he is busy going all over the place,” said Sunil on a recent morning in Colombo, vowing never to vote for Sirisena again.  Sirisena’s trip to China, where he met President Xi Jinping, was pre-planned and beneficial to the nation, coordinating secretary Shiral Lakthilaka told Reuters. Sirisena returned to Sri Lanka on Thursday and only addressed attacks on Muslim homes and shops on Friday, five days after the violence erupted.   Some disgruntled Sri Lankans were also frustrated that Sirisena’s son’s wedding went ahead. It was originally scheduled to be held in the Shangri-La, which was bombed, and ultimately celebrated at the Hilton Colombo.  Sirisena, one user identified as @sankadon tweeted, “cant even postpone the extravagant wedding at least (for) the tears and blood of the people who lost their lives due to his inability”.  Spokesman Ekanayake pushed back at the criticism, saying the wedding was scaled down and that Sirisena did not attend all the festivities.  ELECTION YEAR  The criticism comes on top of accusations that government paralysis due to a feud between Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe prevented warnings about the attacks from being disseminated.  Both men, who fell out after a political crisis in October, say they were not privy to the warnings. Sirisena was in Singapore with family when the attackers struck. He returned to Colombo 15 hours later, appointed a panel to probe defense lapses and replaced both the police chief and the defense secretary.  There are no political polls in Sri Lanka, but analysts said Sirisena was on the back foot in elections that must be held by December.  “President Sirisena does not have a fighting chance,” said Eurasia analyst Akhil Bery.  Wickremesinghe is also seen as a lame duck due to disappointment over the economy under his watch. His allies say two more popular politicians from the United National Party, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya or Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa, could run instead.  To be sure, Sirisena’s chances of re-election prior to the attack were also seen as slim, but he had been vying for an alliance with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.  That now seems impossible, with Rajapaksa’s brother, Gotabaya, who is running for office, doubling down on criticism that the attacks happened because the government dismantled intelligence networks he built up during Sri Lanka’s 25-year civil war with Tamil rebels.  “Sirisena had the idea of contesting, but there is no chance at all (of winning), especially after the attack,” said political commentator Kusal Perera. Auto rickshaw driver Shantha, who did not provide a surname, has switched from supporting Sirisena to backing Rajapaksa.  “We did not see quick decisions to bring the situation in the country back under control,” Shantha, 37, said of the government. “I will vote only if Gotabaya Rajapaksa contests.”  Additional reporting by Ranga Sirisal; Writing by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Nick MacfieOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

"May 11, 2020",BDX,"                Fitch Affirms Becton, Dickinson at 'BBB-'/Stable; Rates Unsecured Notes 'BBB-' - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Credit RSSMay 11, 2020 /  2:44 PM / 2 months agoFitch Affirms Becton, Dickinson at 'BBB-'/Stable; Rates Unsecured Notes 'BBB-'21 Min Read(The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Austin-May 11: Fitch Ratings has affirmed Becton, Dickinson  Company’s (BDX) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘BBB-‘ with a Stable Outlook. Fitch has also assigned a ‘BBB-‘ rating to the company’s unsecured notes issuance. The bond offering is effectively leverage neutral, excluding the temporary impact from the coronavirus pandemic. The affirmation is supported by the company’s offering of value-based products and technologies that help improve treatment outcomes and restrain unnecessary costs. Continued focus on operational efficiencies should drive consistently positive cash generation, enabling the company to continue to reduce debt over the next two years. BDX successfully reached Fitch’s target of gross debt/EBITDA of 3.5x following the acquisition of C.R. Bard, which is commensurate with the ‘BBB-‘ IDR. BDX’s commitment to continued debt reduction could result in positive momentum for the IDR. The ratings apply to $19.4 billion of debt at Dec. 31, 2019. Key Rating Drivers Coronavirus Impact: COVID-19 has had a mixed impact on BDX’s overall business, as the company’s critical care solutions are in high demand but this likely will not fully offset near-term pressures in businesses tied to routine and non-acute care, elective procedures and research. The COVID-19 outbreak primarily impacts the interventional business through reduced elective procedures, the life sciences business due to temporary research lab closures and reduced clinical testing, and the medication management solutions business due to some delays of instrument installations. While Fitch expects near-term demand for select business segments to be dampened, we currently forecast improved healthcare utilization in the second half of CY2020. Fitch anticipates FY2020 EBITDA margin pressure because of the loss of higher-margin elective procedures and products and a product mix shift to lower-margin items. These effects will not be fully offset by BDX’s temporary cost reduction measures. Fitch still forecasts relatively robust FCF that will continue to support operations and should allow for some debt reduction this year. Fitch assumes the $1 billion debt reduction that BDX has committed to publicly will likely span into CY2021, resulting in a longer timeframe to reach the company’s goal of 3.0x leverage by the end of CY2020. Affirmation of the ‘BBB-‘ IDR with a Stable Outlook contemplates the long-term viability and demand of the business and the commitment to debt reduction that may be slightly delayed. Broadened Portfolio Positioned for Long-Term: The evolving dynamics of healthcare reimbursement, including the increasing need for manufacturers and innovators to demonstrate the value of their products to command market share and pricing growth, contributes to consolidation in the medical device industry. Favorable demographics and ongoing technological advancements will continue to support relatively reliable end-market demand growth. BDX, through its global leadership positions, scale and distribution network, is able to provide a fairly comprehensive product portfolio to healthcare providers and act as a one-stop-shop, creating value and efficiencies for its customer base. BDX is also committed to innovation through its RD pipeline to develop new products and solutions that improve outcomes and reduce healthcare system costs. Deleveraging In-Line With Rating: The ‘BBB-‘ rating reflects that BDX successfully reached gross debt/EBITDA of around 3.5x within two years following the close of the Bard acquisition. Fitch calculates gross debt/EBITDA of 3.6x at Dec. 31, 2019. While the effects of the coronavirus pandemic may stress leverage in the near term, Fitch expects cash generation to remain relatively strong to allow for further debt reduction over the next two years. BDX remains committed to further debt reduction, which could result in positive rating momentum as leverage improves through continued debt paydown and EBITDA margin improvement to normalized levels or beyond. Debt has already been reduced by approximately USD3.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2019, versus the Dec. 31, 2017 level. BDX increased its acquisitive posture with the 2017 acquisition of Bard and the 2015 acquisition of CareFusion. Prior to these transactions, BDX was historically only modestly acquisitive, evidenced by its cumulative execution of roughly USD500 million of net cash acquisitions since fiscal 2000, excluding Bard and CareFusion. Further Operational Improvement Expected: BDX continues to improve operations, evidenced by top-line growth, moderately improving margins and increasingly positive FCF. BDX is on track to integrate Bard successfully and to realize the approximately USD300 million of cost synergies targeted within its three-year goal. Revenue synergies are also well under way. Fitch expects margins will decline temporarily in FY2020 in part due to the loss of higher-margin products but will rebound in FY2021 as elective surgeries come back online. Offering Value to Providers: Many of BDX’s products are on the right side of the value equation in health care. Reducing infection rates, improving medication compliance and increasing provider efficiency all contribute to improving treatment outcomes for patients. Improved outcomes and reduction in medication loss, theft and shelf-life expiries also help reduce costs to providers. The company develops products that offer a strong value proposition, which should support the firm’s ability to continue negotiating favorable payment terms with customers. Derivation Summary BDX is a broadly diversified company with leading market positions in the majority of product platforms and treatment segments in which it operates. The firm is in the top-tier of medical device, diagnostics and product firms in terms of size and scale. BDX is larger and more diversified than Baxter International Inc. (BAX, A-/Stable) and Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX, BBB/Stable). However, its recent acquisitive posture has resulted in higher debt leverage than BAX and BSX. BDX is of similar size and holds leading market positions much like Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO, BBB/Stable), a life sciences and diagnostics player. TMO maintains an aggressive capital deployment strategy and operates with gross debt/EBITDA around 2.8x-3.2x. A large portion of sales are generated by consumable and disposable products, reducing BDX’s exposure to potential pricing headwinds to sale of larger and more expensive capital equipment and implantable medical devices. Improving operations, a stable operating environment and an ability to consistently generate meaningfully positive FCF support the company’s credit profile, while its recently increased acquisitive stance weighs on the rating profile. Key Assumptions Fitch’s Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer: —COVID-19’s largest impact will be to the company’s Q3’20 results with some return to normal utilization starting in company’s Q4’20 results; —Organic revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digits during normalized periods; —EBITDA margin pressure in FY2020 due to product mix shift and loss of higher-margin business; —EBITDA margins rebound to normalized levels of +31% in FY 2021; —Normalized annual FCF (CFO minus capex and dividends) of over USD2.0 billionؘ; —Gross debt/EBITDA declines toward 3.0x over 2021-2022 through a combination of EBITDA growth and debt paydown; —Targeted acquisitions and no share repurchases in the near term. RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade: —BDX generates continued strong operating performance that produces consistently positive and increasing FCF; —The company demonstrates the willingness, a rationale and an ability to maintain gross debt/EBITDA around 3.0x, with acquisitions driving leverage above that for only relatively short periods of 12-24 months. Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade: —BDX fails to generate stable operating performance, and FCF materially and durably deteriorates; —Gross debt/EBITDA maintained above 3.5x due to sustained operational deterioration or a more aggressive capital deployment strategy; —The negative rating sensitivities are likely to be tripped if the coronavirus outbreak has a greater impact on cash flow that Fitch currently anticipates or BDX recovers lost revenue and EBITDA more slowly than expected beginning in later 2020 and into 2021. Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit here Liquidity and Debt Structure Sufficient Liquidity: BDX presently has sufficient liquidity, including availability of roughly USD1.9 billion on its USD2.6 billion revolving credit facility at March 31, 2020. Liquidity is bolstered by consistently strong cash generation and cash on hand of USD2.4 billion, which includes a USD1.9 billion short-term unsecured term loan to secure liquidity during market uncertainty related to the coronavirus pandemic. Fitch expects liquidity to remain strong throughout the forecast period. FCF to Reduce Debt: BDX financed the Bard acquisition with a combination of term loan debt, unsecured bonds and equity. Leverage reduction has been aided by prepayable term loans and near-term bond maturities. Further near-term reduction is expected through repayment of revolver borrowings. Fitch expects BDX will direct most of the cash it generates toward debt repayment until it reaches gross debt/EBITDA of 3.0x.

"May 22, 2017",BDX,"                Fitch Rates Becton, Dickinson and Company's Senior Notes 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States IntelMay 22, 2017 /  1:58 PM / 3 years agoFitch Rates Becton, Dickinson and Company's Senior Notes 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable17 Min Read(The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to Becton, Dickinson and Company's (BDX) senior unsecured notes offering. The company intends to use net proceeds from the offering to partly finance the acquisition of C.R. Bard (Bard) and redeem outstanding BDX notes. A full list of ratings appears at the end of the release. The ratings apply to approximately $10.3 billion of debt outstanding at March 31, 2017. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Bard Acquisition Strategically Sound: BDX recently announced plans to acquire Bard for total consideration of about $26 billion including assumption of Bard's debt. Fitch believes the acquisition makes strategic sense. The combination will expand BDX's product offerings in infection prevention and medication management. While BDX already has leading positions in these two areas, the addition of Bard's portfolio will enable BDX to supply healthcare providers with a more complete set of therapeutic tools. The acquisition will also give BDX opportunities to drive high growth platforms in vascular access and biosurgery, as well as a platform on which to build Bard's relatively early-phase expansion into international markets. Extended High Leverage: The Bard acquisition will occur fairly quickly on the heels of the $12 billion acquisition of CareFusion in 2015, extending a period of elevated leverage. The 'BBB-' rating reflects Fitch's expectation that BDX will follow a similar deleveraging path as it did after the purchase of CareFusion; as of its earnings call on May 2, 2017, BDX's debt leverage (Total Debt/EBITDA) declined to below 3.0 times (x), which was within two years of the CareFusion acquisition. Fitch expects pro forma leverage at the Bard acquisition closing of roughly 4.7x, and, assuming a relatively smooth integration, the company should easily generate enough cash flow to reduce debt to below the 3.5x level that Fitch views as consistent with the 'BBB-' rating within two years. Based on Fitch's EBITDA forecast for the combined company, BDX will need to pay down slightly more than $2 billion of debt within the two years following the transaction to reduce leverage to 3.5x. Assuming a slightly increasing dividend, Fitch forecasts annual FCF generation post acquisition of greater than $2 billion. This deleveraging trajectory is also consistent with the plan the company has articulated to reduce debt to below 3.0x EBITDA over a three year period. Recent Acquisitive Posture: BDX has recently increased its acquisitive posture with its bid for Bard and the acquisition of CareFusion in 2015, and Fitch believes this shift makes strategic sense. The evolving dynamics of healthcare reimbursement, including the increasing need for manufacturers and innovators to demonstrate the value of their products to command market share and pricing growth, has contributed to consolidation in the medical device industry. BDX has historically been only modestly acquisitive, evidenced by the fact that it has cumulatively executed roughly $500 million of net cash acquisitions since fiscal year 2000, excluding CareFusion. Solid and Improving Operations: BDX has improved operations during the past four years; this is evidenced by top-line growth, expanding margins and generating increasingly positive FCF. The ongoing successful integration of CareFusion bodes well for the prospects of integrating Bard and realizing the approximately $300 million of cost synergies targeted as part of the return profile of the transaction. Expected Strong FCF: Fitch expects normalized annual FCF of the combined firm to be greater than $2 billion. Fitch's expectation of moderately accelerating organic revenue growth and expanding margins will drive the improved cash generation. The stepped-up FCF generation will be necessary in order for BDX to pay down sufficient debt to reduce leverage to below the 3.5x level consistent with the 'BBB-' rating. Offering Value to Providers: Many of the combined firm's products are on the right side of the value equation in health care. Reducing infection rates, improving medication compliance, and increasing provider efficiency all contribute to improving treatment outcomes for patients. Improved outcomes and reduction in medication loss, theft, and shelf-life expiries also help to reduce costs to providers. The company develops products that offer a strong value proposition, which should support the firm's ability to continue negotiating favorable payment terms with customers. DERIVATION SUMMARY The combined Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX) and C. R. Bard, Inc. (Bard) is a broadly diversified company with leading market positions in the majority of product platforms and treatment segments in which it operates. The combination also places the firm in the top-tier of medical device, diagnostics and product firms in terms of size and scale. A large portion of sales will be generated by consumable and disposable products, reducing BDX's exposure to potential pricing headwinds to sale of larger and more expensive capital equipment and implantable medical devices. Improving operations, a stable operating environment and an ability to consistently generate meaningfully positive FCF support the company's credit profile. However, its recently increased acquisitive stance weighs on the rating profile. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Bard acquisition closes early in BDX's fiscal 2018 and is financed substantially as proposed, with $1.7 billion balance sheet cash, $12.85 billion of equity and equity-linked securities that quality for 100% equity treatment under Fitch's criteria, $1.6 billion assumed Bard debt and $10 billion in new debt. --Organic revenue growth in the mid-single digits. --EBITDA margin increases to 32-33%, with the achievement of cost synergies from the Bard acquisition. --Normalized annual FCF (CFO - CapEx - Dividends) of $2 billion-$2.5 billion post-acquisition. --Leverage to decrease to 3.5x within two years of the Bard acquisition closing due to a combination of EBITDA growth and debt paydown. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --BDX generates continued strong operating performance that produces consistently positive and increasing FCF. --The integration of Bard and the related $300 million of cost synergies are largely achieved by 2020. --The company demonstrates the willingness, a rationale and an ability to maintain leverage durably below 3.0x, with acquisitions driving leverage above that for only relatively short periods of 12-24 months. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --BDX fails to generate stable operating performance, and FCF materially and durably deteriorates. --The integration of Bard and the related $300 million of cost synergies fall substantially short of expectations. --Leverage fails to decline below 3.5x by within two years of the Bard acquisition. --The company pursues a more aggressive capital deployment stance regarding acquisitions and/or share repurchases. LIQUIDITY Sufficient Liquidity: BDX presently has sufficient liquidity, including a $2.25 billion revolving credit facility. Liquidity is bolstered by consistently strong cash generation. Fitch expects liquidity to remain strong throughout the forecast period. FCF to Reduce Debt Post-Acquisition: BDX will finance the Bard acquisition with a combination of term loan debt, unsecured bonds and equity. Pre-payable term loans of $2.25 billion and near-term bond maturities (approximately $4.13 billion) will allow BDX to reduce leverage through debt reduction over the next three years. Fitch expects that BDX will direct most of the cash it generates toward debt repayment until it reaches total debt to EBITDA of 3.0x, at which point debt will likely be refinanced rather than retired. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Becton, Dickinson and Company as follows: --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable; --Senior unsecured credit facility 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB-'.

"May 23, 2017",BDX,"                Fitch Rates Becton, Dickinson and Company's Senior Euro Notes 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States IntelMay 23, 2017 /  10:34 AM / 3 years agoFitch Rates Becton, Dickinson and Company's Senior Euro Notes 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable17 Min Read(The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 23 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to Becton, Dickinson and Company's (BDX) senior unsecured Euro notes offering. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund the purchase of existing notes pursuant to the tender, to fund the purchase and retirement of debt in open market transactions, or otherwise, for general corporate purposes. A full list of ratings appears at the end of the release. The ratings apply to approximately $10.3 billion of debt outstanding at March 31, 2017. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Bard Acquisition Strategically Sound: BDX recently announced plans to acquire Bard for total consideration of about $26 billion including assumption of Bard's debt. Fitch believes the acquisition makes strategic sense, and that the combination will expand BDX's product offerings in infection prevention and medication management. While BDX already has leading positions in these two areas, the addition of Bard's portfolio will enable BDX to supply healthcare providers with a more complete set of therapeutic tools. The acquisition will also give BDX opportunities to drive high-growth platforms in vascular access and biosurgery, as well as a platform on which to build Bard's relatively early-phase expansion into international markets. Extended High Leverage:  The Bard acquisition will occur fairly quickly on the heels of the $12 billion acquisition of CareFusion in 2015, extending a period of elevated leverage. The 'BBB-' rating reflects Fitch's expectation that BDX will follow a similar deleveraging path as it did after the purchase of CareFusion; as of its earnings call on May 2, 2017, BDX's debt leverage (Total Debt/EBITDA) declined to below 3x, which was within two years of the CareFusion acquisition. Fitch expects pro forma leverage at the Bard acquisition closing of roughly 4.7x, and assuming a relatively smooth integration, the company should easily generate enough cash flow to reduce debt to below the 3.5x level that Fitch views as consistent with the 'BBB-' rating within two years. Based on Fitch's EBITDA forecast for the combined company, BDX will need to pay down slightly more than $2 billion of debt within the two years following the transaction to reduce leverage to 3.5x. Assuming a slightly increasing dividend, Fitch forecasts annual FCF generation post-acquisition of greater than $2 billion. This deleveraging trajectory is also consistent with the plan the company has articulated to reduce debt to below 3x EBITDA over a three-year period. Recent Acquisitive Posture: BDX has recently increased its acquisitive posture with its bid for Bard and the acquisition of CareFusion in 2015, and Fitch believes this shift makes strategic sense. The evolving dynamics of healthcare reimbursement, including the increasing need for manufacturers and innovators to demonstrate the value of their products to command market share and pricing growth, has contributed to consolidation in the medical device industry. BDX has historically been only modestly acquisitive, evidenced by the fact that it has cumulatively executed roughly $500 million of net cash acquisitions since fiscal 2000, excluding CareFusion. Solid and Improving Operations: BDX has improved operations during the past four years, as is evidenced by top-line growth, expanding margins and generating increasingly positive FCF. The ongoing successful integration of CareFusion bodes well for the prospects of integrating Bard and realizing the approximately $300 million of cost synergies targeted as part of the return profile of the transaction. Expected Strong FCF: Fitch expects normalized annual FCF of the combined firm to be greater than $2 billion. Fitch's expectation of moderately accelerating organic revenue growth and expanding margins will drive the improved cash generation. The stepped-up FCF generation will be necessary in order for BDX to pay down sufficient debt to reduce leverage to below the 3.5x level consistent with the 'BBB-' rating. Offering Value to Providers: Many of the combined firm's products are on the right side of the value equation in health care. Reducing infection rates, improving medication compliance, and increasing provider efficiency all contribute to improving treatment outcomes for patients. Improved outcomes and reduction in medication loss, theft, and shelf-life expiries also help to reduce costs to providers. The company develops products that offer a strong value proposition, which should support the firm's ability to continue negotiating favorable payment terms with customers. DERIVATION SUMMARY The combined Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX) and C. R. Bard, Inc. (Bard) would be a broadly diversified company with leading market positions in the majority of product platforms and treatment segments in which it operates. The combination also places the firm in the top-tier of medical device, diagnostics and product firms in terms of size and scale. A large portion of sales will be generated by consumable and disposable products, reducing BDX's exposure to potential pricing headwinds to sale of larger and more expensive capital equipment and implantable medical devices. Improving operations, a stable operating environment and an ability to consistently generate meaningfully positive FCF support the company's credit profile. However, its recently increased acquisitive stance weighs on the rating profile. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Bard acquisition closes early in BDX's fiscal 2018 and is financed substantially as proposed, with $1.7 billion balance sheet cash, $12.85 billion of equity and equity-linked securities that quality for 100% equity treatment under Fitch's criteria, $1.6 billion assumed Bard debt and $10 billion in new debt. --Organic revenue growth in the mid-single digits. --EBITDA margin increases to 32%-33%, with the achievement of cost synergies from the Bard acquisition. --Normalized annual FCF (CFO - CapEx - Dividends) of $2 billion-$2.5 billion post-acquisition. --Leverage to decrease to 3.5x within two years of the Bard acquisition closing due to a combination of EBITDA growth and debt paydown. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action --BDX generates continued strong operating performance that produces consistently positive and increasing FCF. --The integration of Bard and the related $300 million of cost synergies are largely achieved by 2020. --The company demonstrates the willingness, a rationale and an ability to maintain leverage durably below 3.0x, with acquisitions driving leverage above that for only relatively short periods of 12-24 months. Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action --BDX fails to generate stable operating performance, and FCF materially and durably deteriorates. --The integration of Bard and the related $300 million of cost synergies fall substantially short of expectations. --Leverage fails to decline below 3.5x by within two years of the Bard acquisition; --The company pursues a more aggressive capital deployment stance regarding acquisitions and/or share repurchases. LIQUIDITY Sufficient Liquidity: BDX presently has sufficient liquidity, including a $2.25 billion revolving credit facility. Liquidity is bolstered by consistently strong cash generation. Fitch expects liquidity to remain strong throughout the forecast period. FCF to Reduce Debt Post-Acquisition: BDX will finance the Bard acquisition with a combination of term loan debt, unsecured bonds and equity. Pre-payable term loans of $2.25 billion and near-term bond maturities (approximately $4.13 billion) will allow BDX to reduce leverage through debt reduction over the next three years. Fitch expects that BDX will direct most of the cash it generates toward debt repayment until it reaches total debt to EBITDA of 3x, at which point debt will likely be refinanced rather than retired.

"July 20, 2020",BEN,"                U.S. companies fear workplace coronavirus precautions do not address airborne risk - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsJuly 20, 2020 /  11:09 AM / a day agoU.S. companies fear workplace coronavirus precautions do not address airborne riskCaroline Humer5 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. companies are raising new questions about how they can make workplaces safe after the world’s top public health agency acknowledged the risk that tiny airborne droplets of the novel coronavirus may contribute to its spread, industry healthcare consultants said. About two weeks ago, the World Health Organization called for more scientific study into airborne transmission of COVID-19. The move raised awareness of an issue excluded from U.S. government back-to-work guidelines, adding to the challenge of keeping people safe in offices, stores and work sites, these consultants said.  Many companies devised strategies based on WHO guidance that large respiratory droplets of the virus could infect people when first emitted and after they landed on surfaces. Now the concern over infection is focused on the idea that tiny droplets could linger in the air for hours. Companies are reviewing if they have gone far enough with policies on mask-wearing, sealing off conference rooms and upgrading ventilation systems. Some, like retailers who have installed plexiglass barriers in their stores between cashiers and customers, are wondering what else they can do if the larger droplets those barriers aim to contain are just one piece of respiratory transmission, consultants said.   Neal Mills, chief medical officer at healthcare benefits group Aon, began fielding questions last week about the WHO’s decision to investigate aerosol transmission, and said employers were slowing the return of remote workers back to their offices. “They are doing due diligence around how are you going to reduce the transmission of the virus in light of the proposed aerosol nature of COVID-19,” Mills said. The slowdown comes as some employers, such as Texas energy companies Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Chevron Corp (CVS.N), had already begun delaying plans to bring back office workers due to rising coronavirus cases.   Employers are asking whether public health recommendations that individuals remain 6 feet apart and wear masks to limit transmission through large droplets are enough.  They also wonder about air conditioning systems that do not have filtration systems and the effectiveness of plexiglass partitions against a virus floating in the air, said David Zieg, a lead consultant on clinical services at Mercer, another healthcare services companies. Consultants are advising employers to go beyond their existing plans, which may also include temperature checks, health questionnaires and frequent restroom cleanings. “The concept here is risk reduction. It’s not 100%. You add in all the little things you can to reduce the risk,” Zieg said. Months after U.S. companies sent all but essential workers home due to the global new coronavirus pandemic, many are still struggling to bring their workforce back.  For some employers, the cost of not putting in effective precautions goes beyond that of workers missing days while they are sick. There are concerns about legal liability and healthcare costs, many of which are paid for by large employers.  Some corporations moved early and began integrating the possibility of airborne transmission of COVID-19 into their plans as evidence began emerging of transmission at indoor bars and restaurants.

REUTERS/Stephen LamGeneral Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) maximized ventilation in their manufacturing facilities before restarting production on May 18 because of the potential for aerosol transmission, the companies said.  But others are more than halving the number of workers they bring back to the office to 10 percent of staff and rethinking how many people can safely ride in an elevator or attend an in-person meeting, Willis Towers Watson health practice co-leader Jeff Levin-Scherz said. “Once you start limiting how many people can be in a conference room, the imperative to bring some types of workers back to the office, if they have to attend meetings virtually anyway, is much lower,” Towers Watson’s Levin-Scherz said.

REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/File PhotoPARIS (Reuters) - Air France-KLM (AIR.PA) has struck a tentative deal with French pilots to transfer some domestic services to low-cost subsidiary Transavia, as the airline group steps up restructuring in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, the main pilots’ union said. A draft deal is “on the table” but has yet to be signed subject to approval by members, a spokeswoman for Air France’s main SNPL pilots’ union said, confirming a report by French daily La Tribune. Air France declined to comment. The Franco-Dutch group aims to cut some 7,580 jobs by the end of next year as airlines struggle to weather the COVID-19 pandemic and a resulting slump in global travel. Chief Executive Ben Smith is accelerating cost-cutting measures including the transfer of French domestic services from Air France and its HOP! unit to Transavia. The move requires changes to union agreements that currently bar the no-frills division from competing on domestic routes.

The headquarters of testing firm DYNALABS are seen in St Louis, Missouri, U.S., July 9, 2020. Picture taken July 9, 2020.  REUTERS/Lawrence BryantThe House of Representative’s Oversight Committee wrote to three laboratories identified in a Reuters investigation published on Friday into the companies involved in a secret supply chain to make and test the drug. In a fourth letter, the lawmakers also identified a company that may have helped make the drug.  The letters asked the companies to provide information about their role in helping the Justice Department acquire a supply of pentobarbital, the powerful barbiturate that the department used to execute Daniel Lee, a convicted murderer, earlier on Tuesday. The Justice Department has rebuffed requests by lawmakers, journalists and death row inmates to identify the companies involved, saying they will only do the work if secrecy is assured.  But ARL Bio Pharma in Oklahoma City, Eagle Analytical Services in Houston and DYNALABS in St. Louis all confirmed to Reuters that they produced the quality-control test results that the Justice Department cited in court filings. A fourth letter was sent to Absolute Standards in Hamden, Connecticut, a company that makes samples of highly pure chemicals for use in calibrating laboratory testing equipment. The letter, signed by Democratic committee members Jamie Raskin and Ayanna Pressley, indicates that lawmakers believe Absolute Standards may be the manufacturer of a raw, powdered form of pentobarbital for the Justice Department. The department has said it has also hired a pharmacy to mix that powder into a sterile, injectible solution.  The letter to Absolute Standards includes redacted lab records the Justice Department said were supplied by its manufacturer.  Because the chemicals Absolute Standards normally makes are not intended for use in humans or animals, it has not needed to register as a controlled substances manufacturer with the Drug Enforcement Administration.  In September 2018, according to the Federal Register, the company sought DEA approval for the first time to become a so-called “bulk manufacturer” of just one controlled substance: pentobarbital.  A few weeks later, an unnamed company described as a “bulk manufacturer” began producing raw pentobarbital powder for the Justice Department, the department’s court filings show. Stephen Arpie, the director of Absolute Standards, did not respond to requests for comment on the lawmakers’ letter. In interviews with Reuters earlier this year, Arpie at first said his company had no involvement in the government’s execution drugs. He later said he did not always know what his customers did with his products, and so could not rule out involvement. “In many parts of our market, we don’t know what the final intended use is going to be,” he said.

FILE PHOTO: 2016 Rio Olympics - Athletics - Final - Men's Decathlon 1500m - Olympic Stadium - Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - 18/08/2016. Ashton Eaton (USA) of USA celebrates winning the gold medal.  REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi Picture Supplied by Action Images/File PhotoEaton, who retired from athletics in 2017, is studying for a second degree in mechanical engineering and is also part of a project at U.S. tech firm Intel aimed at helping athletes squeeze every last bit of performance out of their bodies. While the company lists his job as: ‘Product Development Engineer’, Eaton’s LinkedIn bio simply reads: “2x Olympic gold medallist, decathlon. Now pursuing engineering.” “Ultimately (I) decided I wanted to learn the fundamentals of science and engineering,” Eaton told Reuters in a recent interview.  “(Intel) asked if I would like to join the project and I just saw it as an awesome opportunity to mix what I knew with my passion about learning about science and tech.” The 32-year-old said the project was focused on using technology to show athletes the difference between how they think their body is performing and the actual measurable data.  “If you can bridge the gap between what it feels like... and what you actually did from a skeleton’s perspective, that is a huge leap forward for how people can not only train but start out and learn how to do these things,” he added.  “That is what our project is working on; to extract how the skeleton is working and hopefully use that to not only give athletes insight and improve their performance, but also help fans who are watching sports deepen their understanding of what is going on.” The technology is already being used to help athletes who are having to adjust training schedules ahead of the rearranged Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to start this month but have been pushed back a year due to the coronavirus pandemic. In addition to his two Olympic golds at London and Rio, Eaton also set the decathlon world record of 9,045 points in 2015, though this was later beaten by Frenchman Kevin Mayer. “For me, the thing that gave me the most satisfaction, or allowed me to be okay with being done, was breaking the world record,” he said.  “I loved going to the Olympics and winning medals but, for me, increasing the points was always motivation.”  “That is why I love the decathlon, why I love track and field, because it is so measurable. If progress is your goal, you know where you stand.”  Editing by Peter RutherfordOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

"July 15, 2020",BIO,"                Indonesia produces maiden batch of biodiesel made of 100% palm - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States CommoditiesJuly 15, 2020 /  12:00 PM / 6 days agoIndonesia produces maiden batch of biodiesel made of 100% palm2 Min ReadJakarta (Reuters) - Indonesia’s state oil company PT Pertamina produced its first successful batch of biodiesel made up of 100% palm oil (D100) in its Dumai refinery last week and is set to produce 1,000 barrels per day (bpd), the company said on Wednesday. Indonesia, which has one of the world’s most ambitious biodiesel programmes, raised the bio-content in its biodiesel mandate to 30% (B30) late last year from 20% (B20) before, and is planning to upgrade the bio-content gradually to 100%.  “This trial shows that our refinery and catalysts are ready. Next, we have to think how to make the economic side work too,”  Pertamina CEO Nicke Widyawati said in a statement. In Indonesia - the world’s largest palm oil producer - the bio portion of biodiesel is made with fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) from palm oil, but efforts to increase FAME concentrations in biodiesel have faced resistance from users. While biodiesel can cut fuel costs and reduce emissions, higher blends of FAME require special handling and equipment as the fuel has a solvent effect that can corrode engine seals and gasket materials, and it can solidify at cold temperatures. Instead of using crude palm oil to create FAME and mixing it with regular diesel, the D100 “Green Diesel”, processes refined, bleached and deodorized palm oil straight into its refinery using catalytic cracking and hydrogen gas, the statement said.  The biodiesel programme is a key part of the government’s strategy to soak up excess supplies of palm oil and curb expensive fuel imports, one of the main contributors to the country’s current account deficit problem. In May, Indonesia said it is likely to delay plans to raise bio-content in palm oil-based biodiesel to 40%, amid speculation that low crude prices could force a government re-think.

"July 17, 2020",BIO,"                MLS delays launch of three expansion teams due to COVID-19 - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Sports NewsJuly 17, 2020 /  8:24 PM / 4 days agoMLS delays launch of three expansion teams due to COVID-192 Min Read(Reuters) - Major League Soccer has unveiled a revised expansion timeline with the inaugural seasons for three of its four new teams delayed by a year due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.  The new timeline is the result of the impact of the pandemic on the start of business operations and stadium development, the league said. Charlotte, originally scheduled to begin playing in the MLS next season, will now make its debut in 2022 while St. Louis and Sacramento will begin in 2023 instead of 2022.  Austin, which announced its formation earlier than the other clubs, remains on schedule to debut in 2021.   “We have always taken a thoughtful and strategic approach to our expansion planning and have delivered successful launches for every new club,” MLS Commissioner Don Garber said on Friday.  “It is important for each club to take the necessary time to launch their inaugural MLS seasons the way their fans and communities deserve.  “With the extra year to make up for what has been a challenging 2020, these teams will be well-positioned for their debuts and for long-term success.” The addition of teams in Nashville and Miami this season brought the total number of clubs to 26. MLS saw its 25th season derailed by the pandemic in mid-March but returned earlier this month with the “MLS Is Back” tournament, which is being played inside a bio-secure “bubble” at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex near Orlando, Florida.
