"July 6, 2020",AA,"                Moody's signals Canadian provinces can avoid post-COVID-19 downgrades, analysts say - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsJuly 6, 2020 /  5:54 PM / 15 days agoMoody's signals Canadian provinces can avoid post-COVID-19 downgrades, analysts sayFergal Smith2 Min ReadTORONTO (Reuters) - Moody’s Investors Service is expecting Canadian provinces to shift rapidly to stabilizing their rising debt burdens once economic growth resumes, which analysts said could be a signal to provinces on how they can avoid downgrades. The ratings agency said on Monday it expected Canada’s economy to contract by 7% in 2020 because of the coronavirus crisis and all 10 provinces to post “material deficits” in the fiscal year that began in April. That includes an expected deficit of more than 30% of revenue for Alberta, which faces the additional challenge of low oil prices. Fitch downgraded Alberta’s rating last week to AA- from AA. Declining growth will lead to a sharp increase in debt burdens for the provinces this fiscal year, Moody’s said. But the ratings agency sees debt loads stabilizing in 2021-22 as revenue recovers, which could indicate it is in no rush to downgrade the provinces’ debt.  Moody’s report signals “to the extent that the provincial governments return quickly to fiscal consolidation, they will not view the temporary deviation as credit negative,” said Maria Berlettano, head of Canadian government credit strategy at CIBC Capital Markets. Less than two weeks ago, Canada’s sovereign debt lost one of its coveted triple-A ratings when Fitch downgraded it for the first time, citing expected much higher public debt ratios. Moody’s still gives Canada its highest rating of Aaa. At over C$800 billion ($590 billion), provincial bonds outstanding exceed federal government issuance. “Our view would be that provincial finances are shouldering much less of the COVID burden than the federal government,” said Robert Kavcic, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. “We are expecting the combined provincial deficit at about 3% of GDP this year, versus more than 11% for Ottawa.” Reporting by Fergal Smith; Editing by Dan Grebler and Peter CooneyOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

"July 3, 2020",AA,"                Abu Dhabi's ADQ shores up liquidity with up to US$3bn club loan - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States FinancialsJuly 3, 2020 /  8:49 AM / 19 days agoAbu Dhabi's ADQ shores up liquidity with up to US$3bn club loanSandrine Bradley3 Min ReadLONDON, July 3 (LPC) - Abu Dhabi state-owned holding company ADQ is in the market for a US$2bn-$3bn loan, which is expected to be provided by a club of international lenders, according to banking sources. It is ADQ’s first club loan from international banks and is part of a wider fundraising spree to shore up liquidity for the business, which holds some of Abu Dhabi’s most important non-oil related assets, the bankers said. The deal is being self-arranged by ADQ and is expected to involve a group of five or six banks, the bankers said. The borrower was originally looking for a five-year tenor but is likely to end up with three years. “Five years would be a bit of a stretch, I think three years is more likely,” one banker said. Banks are keen to deploy cash into Abu Dhabi, the largest emirate in the UAE, rated AA by S&P and Fitch and Aa2 by Moody’s, but pricing is very tight, meaning all but a handful lenders will be excluded. “Appetite for an Abu Dhabi deal like this is not limited to the five or six banks that will eventually do the deal, but they are the only ones who can afford to do it. It’s where everyone wants to be but the borrower has high pricing expectations,” said a second banker. Alongside the club loan, ADQ, formerly known as Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company, has also been raising a number of jumbo local currency dirham-denominated bilateral loans. “There are definitely two bilaterals being discussed and it might end up being three. One of them is bigger than the club loan,” the second banker said. ADQ did not respond to a request for comment. ADQ¸ chaired by Sheikh Tahnoon Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is raising the cash to shore up funds for its existing portfolio companies, the second banker said. They include some of the UAE’s biggest assets, including Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, Abu Dhabi Airports and Senaat, one of the UAE’s largest industrial investment holding companies. “They now have quite a few critical government entities under them. They don’t need immediate support but I guess having and keeping liquidity is key for when they might need it and to help any businesses which might have suffered due to Covid,” he said. Cash could also be needed to fund ADQ’s ongoing acquisition spree. In March it acquired a 50% stake in Abu Dhabi-based agriculture firm Al Dahra Holding and it is among the bidders for Jordan food producer Al Jazeera Agriculture Company. It is also close to acquiring Jordan’s Al-Nabil Food Industries, which produces frozen foods. ADQ was established in 2018 and has a portfolio of 90 assets across 11 sectors in Abu Dhabi’s non-oil economy, including media, utilities, real estate, healthcare, transport and tourism.

"November 5, 2019",AAN,"                Indonesia's surfer girls turn the tide on sexism - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States AsiaNovember 5, 2019 /  12:02 AM / 9 months agoIndonesia's surfer girls turn the tide on sexismBeh Lih Yi6 Min ReadKUTA, Indonesia (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Standing on her surfboard as it was lifted by a wave, Zahwa Ardika Utami is one of a small but growing number of girls breaking with Indonesian tradition to take up the macho sport.   Not only is surfing one of the world’s most dangerous sports, it is also frowned upon for women in the world’s most populous Muslim country to bare their bodies and allow their skin to tan. Women in rural areas are expected to stay at home. “I love surfing because I can chase the waves,” 12-year-old Utami told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on a traditional wooden outrigger boat after surfing on a sunny morning. “When I don’t surf, I help my parents with cooking or looking after my younger sister,” she said as the boat returned to Lombok island, one of Indonesia’s best-known surf spots. Few local women surf in the Southeast Asian archipelago of 17,000 islands, which has some of the world’s best beaches, dive and surf spots, including Bali and Raja Ampat, attracting millions of visitors each year. With surfing set to debut at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, the sport’s enthusiasts hope that young girls like Utami will help to turn the tide on sexism in Indonesia and emulate pioneering professional women surfers like Bali’s Diah Rahayu. Utami is a student at XX Surf, a surf school and social enterprise - a business with a social mission - on Lombok seeking to empower girls through the sport while also tackling issues such as child marriage and teen pregnancy. Indonesia has the world’s eighth-highest number of child brides, according to the United Nations, with one in nine girls marrying before they turn 18 due to poverty and tradition.     NAUGHTY On Lombok, just east of the resort island of Bali, rampant underage marriage has been linked to social ills ranging from high rates of divorce to unplanned pregnancies, maternal deaths and stunting among children. XX Surf was set up with a mission to change that.     Although local women rarely defy social expectations by jumping on a surf board, Indonesia’s Bali island has women-exclusive “surf retreats” and is a top spot that attracts female surfers from around the world. Enthusiasm is growing slowly in the country, with 17-year-old Kailani Johnson making history in May as the first Indonesian woman to compete in the professional World Surf League Women’s Championship Tour. Founded in June, XX Surf - which takes its name from the female chromosomes - offers lessons to tourists at a fee but it is also training local girls for free to give them a taste of life outside marriage. “We want to empower them so they know more about the outside world,” said XX Surf’s co-founder Dedi Susandra, a 27-year-old former hotel manager-turned-coach.  Susandra, himself from Lombok, said local girls are often discouraged from surfing due to religious taboos about figure-hugging attire like wetsuits, pressure to do housework and fears that it will lead to wayward behavior, like casual sex. “Most parents think surfers lead a free lifestyle and if their daughter surfs, they will become ‘naughty’,” he said. FREEDOM Women and girls are at greater risk of drowning in cultures where beliefs about modesty deter them from learning to swim. Women accounted for 77% of deaths from the devastating 2004 tsunami in Indonesia’s conservative province of Aceh, a study by aid group Oxfam found, partly because more men could swim or climb trees. Bangladesh and China both have high rates of children dying by drowning, with girls especially vulnerable, according to campaign group Teach a Girl to Swim, which says the skill is important for responding to flooding linked to climate change. XX Surf, which donates a third of its profits to a local charity supporting girls’ education, said girls should be given the right to enjoy sports which help build higher self-esteem. “They have a lot of potentials,” said co-founder Alice Stanbury, a keen surfer who was an earth scientist in native Britain before she moved to Indonesia in 2014 to be with her husband Susandra. “We hope to bring more girls out so they can enjoy themselves, empower them and allow them a bit more freedom and to experience life just like the boys do,” she added. Baiq Zulhiatina, from the Lombok-based charity Child and Youth Protection Institution, which campaigns against early marriage, said sports can inspire girls to see another future. “What is important is that they are taught to dream big, have ambitions and open their mind to something other than marriage,” said the spokeswoman. Back on Tanjung Aan beach, Utami and half a dozen other students practised pop-up - moving from a paddling to standing position - and helped load surfboards on to the boat before they headed out to the sea. Some, including 10-year-old Derla, seemed nervous as they got into the water and had to be encouraged by their coach. They tried to catch the waves, tumbling into the sea. When they succeeded, smiles broke out on their faces. “I’m happy when I surf. My ambition is to be a professional surfer and compete in events,” said Utami, with a wide grin.

The reigning world champion surpassed the 110 classical games undefeated set by Sergei Tiviakov in 2005 after drawing against Jorden van Foreest in the fourth round of the Wijk aan Zee tournament. Carlsen had previously indicated he would not consider the record truly broken until after two more games as he was not prepared to count two wins he had in the Norwegian league.  But the 29-year-old told The Guardian he had softened his stance.  “I’m all for (claiming the streak) too,” he said. “I consider my streak against elite opposition is 109 and against good opposition is 111 and I am happy about that.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter RutherfordOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

"September 24, 2018",AAN,"                UPDATE 4-India struggles to soothe markets as liquidity concerns grow - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Bonds NewsSeptember 24, 2018 /  7:30 AM / 2 years agoUPDATE 4-India struggles to soothe markets as liquidity concerns growAbhirup Roy, Euan Rocha6 Min Read(Adds RBI’s OMO purchase announcement and RBI’s cancellation of certificate of registration for 14 NBFCs) By Abhirup Roy and Euan Rocha MUMBAI, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Indian authorities sought to calm markets on Monday but investors paid little heed as fears that the non-banking financial sector is facing a credit crunch hit domestic bonds, stocks and the rupee, adding to Friday’s selloff. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley tweeted that “the government will take all measures to ensure that adequate liquidity is maintained/provided to the NBFCs,” referring to the non-banking financial companies. His intervention came on the heels of assurances on Sunday from both the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, and market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, that they were closely monitoring developments in financial markets and stood ready to act if needed. However, the benchmark Nifty Index closed 1.58 percent lower on Monday, while the benchmark 10-year bond yield was up 2 basis points at 8.10 percent as bond prices dipped. On Friday, the stock index at one stage plunged more than 3 percent in a 30-minute period. The partially convertible rupee was weaker at 72.54 per dollar versus its previous close at 72.1950 and not far off its record low of 72.99 hit early last week. Investors have been unnerved by credit concerns surrounding two companies in particular. One of the biggest NBFC names in India - Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) - this month defaulted on a series of its coupon payments. Then on Friday, a large fund manager sold short-term bonds issued by home loan provider Dewan Housing Finance at a sharp discount, raising fears of wider liquidity problems in the sector. “The recent tightness of liquidity in the corporate bond markets indicate a contagion effect may be playing out following the default by IL&FS,” said brokerage firm CLSA in a research note on Monday. A big correction in equity markets could hurt Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as they prepare for a series of key state elections later this year and a national election by May 2019. Modi and his BJP swept to power in 2014 on the slogan “Achhe din aane waale hain (good days are coming),” but a lack of jobs, falling crop prices and surging fuel costs have triggered discontent and some protests in recent months. A sell-off in equity markets, which have been one of the few bright spots in the economy, could further dent Modi’s popularity among the small business and trading community, a core base of BJP supporters, who were already stung by two of his largest reform moves -  demonetisation and a nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST). India’s equity markets have hit record highs in 2018 despite sell-offs in domestic bonds and weakness in the rupee, which has been the worst-performing Asian currency this year. Despite the correction this month, the Nifty Index is up more than 4 percent so far this year. But for foreign investors, the drop in the rupee will have wiped out any gains. India’s largest bank, the State Bank of India, also sought to calm investors, issuing a statement on Sunday saying fears that banks were wary of lending to NBFCs were baseless. “SBI lends support to NBFCs in the private and public sector within the regulatory policy framework and will continue to do so,” SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said in a statement. “There is no concern on liquidity of NBFCs in view of their liquid cash position and availability of committed lines.” Jaitley is due to chair an annual review meeting with the chiefs of state-run banks on Tuesday, where he is expected to seek updates on their plans to tackle bad loans. “BEAR PHASE” With defaults from IL&FS and its group companies on the rise, markets are unlikely to calm down in a hurry. Late on Monday, the infrastructure developer and lender said it was unable to service certain debt obligations that fell due that day and also missed interest payments on some short-term bonds that were due over the weekend. Separately, its unit IL&FS Financial Services also said it could not service some debt obligation due Monday. The RBI, late on Monday, said it has cancelled the certificate of registration for 14 NBFCs on August 1. Just last week, it said it had stripped 30 NBFCs of their registrations on July 12. The central bank did not give a reason for the cancellations. (bit.ly/2pupWXQ) The head of a mutual fund, who declined to be named due to company policies, said a number of factors from the rupee to oil are not supportive for India. “The underlying sentiment is so weak the market is not taking any assurances from anybody. It’s not even taking the government at face value any more,” said the mutual fund head. “The market has entered the bear phase, and when the bears take over panic multiplies.” The RBI’s attempts to stem declines in the rupee have driven much of the liquidity tightening in the market, as the bank has been selling dollars and sucking up rupees, leading to higher borrowing rates for big borrowers such as the non-banking financial companies. On Monday, the central bank said it would buy 100 billion Indian rupees ($1.38 billion) of government bonds via an open market operation on September 27. In a note to clients, Morgan Stanley warned that the funding costs for NBFCs are likely to stay elevated for some time. “We expect markets to be more conservative in lending to NBFCs, which is likely to push up pricing,” Morgan Stanley analyst Anil Agarwal said in the note, warning this would also mean slower growth.

"June 4, 2020",AAP,"                U.S. doctors group sues FDA for limiting access to drug touted by Trump for COVID-19 - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Health NewsJune 4, 2020 /  7:43 PM / 2 months agoU.S. doctors group sues FDA for limiting access to drug touted by Trump for COVID-19Allison Martell, Michael Erman4 Min Read(Reuters) - A group of conservative U.S. doctors has sued the Food and Drug Administration for limiting use of the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, arguing that the therapy should be made widely available to fight the pandemic. FILE PHOTO: The drug hydroxychloroquine, pushed by U.S. President Donald Trump and others in recent months as a possible treatment to people infected with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is displayed at the Rock Canyon Pharmacy in Provo, Utah, U.S. May 27, 2020. REUTERS/George Frey/File PhotoThe lawsuit represents the latest front in a highly politicized U.S. debate over access to hydroxychloroquine. The drug has been championed by President Donald Trump as a potential “game-changer” against the coronavirus, but its value has yet to be established. A clinical trial released on Wednesday found it to be ineffective in preventing infection. The FDA, which regulates medicines in the United States, has restricted use of the drug from the national stockpile to COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized and cannot enroll in a clinical trial. States can set their own rules for prescription, with many influenced by the FDA’s warning that the drug has a risk of a side-effect of dangerous heart arrhythmias.   That harms the rights of its member doctors to prescribe as they see fit, causing “economic injury,” the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS) argues in its suit, filed in a Michigan federal district court on Tuesday. An FDA agency spokesperson said it does not comment on pending or ongoing litigation. In a statement published online last week, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said the agency does not prohibit physicians from prescribing medications. “It is important that patients and health care providers understand the known side effects of these drugs, including serious and potentially life-threatening heart rhythm problems,” he said. The AAPS, a non-profit organization based in Tucson, Arizona, has a “few thousand” members, according to executive director Jane Orient. It opposes mandatory vaccination, previously waged a campaign against healthcare reforms introduced by former President Barack Obama, and has been pushing back against state restrictions on use of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive therapy for the coronavirus. AAPS has accused state and federal agencies of “hoarding” hydroxychloroquine while patients die in an outbreak that has killed over 107,000 and infected 1.86 million in the United States to date. The group is running a series of online seminars for doctors on the coronavirus. General counsel Andrew Schlafly discussed legal issues related to prescribing hydroxychloroquine on one in April.  “They could pump out 100 million doses of these things within a week. Everybody in our country could be given them, and that would stop this crisis overnight, most likely,” said Schlafly, who is not a doctor. Richard Chaisson, a Johns Hopkins researcher, is running a trial of the drug to determine whether it is effective in treating patients with moderate to severe versions of the disease. “Right now, the data for hydroxychloroquine is not compelling for any group,” he said in an interview. “Until it’s been studied, I really think it’s irresponsible to recommend it routinely outside of a clinical trial.” Schlafly said in response: “I disagree completely... the data is that the medication is very safe.” More than 35 states have restricted prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine, and at least five of those have rules specifically prohibiting prescribing the drug as a preventive measure.

"June 5, 2020",AAP,"                Australia's AAP news agency lives on after finding buyers - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States World NewsJune 5, 2020 /  7:17 AM / 2 months agoAustralia's AAP news agency lives on after finding buyersByron Kaye2 Min ReadSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Associated Press (AAP) said on Friday it expects to be sold to a group of philanthropic investors, a reprieve for the news agency that had been facing closure, and for the industry, after a run of layoffs as advertising dwindles. AAP had planned to close this month after 85 years but said it now expected to stay in business, albeit with fewer staff, after it and a group of investors agreed on a sale for an undisclosed sum. “After months of discussions with various parties, it appears we have been able to secure a new home for AAP’s legacy of trusted news,” AAP chief executive Bruce Davidson said in a statement.  AAP said the buyers included Peter Tonagh, a former chief executive of the Australian division of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp, and unidentified philanthropists and “impact investors”. The sale is good news for an industry hit by widespread layoffs in recent months as restrictions on movement to contain the novel coronavirus batter the retail sector, cutting advertising revenue that media companies rely on. News Corp’s Australian arm said last week it would stop printing more than 100 newspapers, while the Australian edition of Buzzfeed News and ViacomCBS Inc owned free-to-air broadcaster Ten Network shut down their news sites. AAP’s buyers said they wanted to ensure its long-term survival. “We live in a time where trusted, unbiased news is more important than ever,” Tonagh said in the statement. “AAP has always delivered on that and we are committed to seeing that continue into the future.” Tonagh said the buyers would hire up to 90 AAP staff, including up to 75 editorial staff, about half its workforce. Before it called in administrators in March, AAP’s major shareholders included News Corp and rival newspaper publisher Nine Entertainment Holdings Co Ltd.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump pauses as he speaks prior to signing an Executive Order on the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington, U.S., July 9, 2020. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque“Public health agencies must make recommendations based on evidence, not politics,” the American Academy of Pediatrics, two national teachers’ unions and a school superintendents’ group said, following days of threats by Trump to choke off federal education funds if schools do not open their doors for the upcoming academic year. “We should leave it to health experts to tell us when the time is best to open up school buildings, and listen to educators and administrators to shape how we do it,” AAP, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association and the School Superintendents Association said in a joint statement. Their call was echoed by two medical groups - the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the HIV Medicine Association. Trump ramped up his threat on Friday, saying the Treasury Department would re-examine schools’ tax-exempt status and their federal funding. The Republican president this week also moved to eject foreign students attending universities in the United States if their schools do not offer in-person classes, prompting at least two lawsuits.  His push to reopen schools comes as cases of the novel coronavirus surge in some of the country’s most populous areas, prompting some state and local authorities to roll back plans to relax restrictions. School administrators are weighing the risk of opening their buildings to students and staff as U.S. cases have topped 3 million this week. Some universities have announced online-only instruction plans, while others may change their calendars. New York City schools, the nation’s largest public school district, announced a hybrid plan mixing both on-site and online classes. Trump has accused Democrats of exploiting the pandemic for political gain by refusing to reopen schools and businesses to hurt the economy and his re-election prospects, even as health experts caution against easing restrictions too quickly. “Too many Universities and School Systems are about Radical Left Indoctrination, not Education,” he said in a Twitter post on Friday. “Therefore, I am telling the Treasury Department to re-examine their Tax-Exempt Status and/or Funding, which will be taken away if this Propaganda or Act Against Public Policy continues. Our children must be Educated, not Indoctrinated!”  It was not immediately clear how Treasury could restrict funds, and the department could not be immediately reached for comment. Most primary and secondary school funding is local. In their statement, AAP and the other groups urged Congress to provide more money to schools so they could reopen safely, calling the idea of withholding funds a “misguided approach.” Democrats have said they want students to return to in-person classes but only if it is safe. Trump’s likely rival in the November election, former Vice President Joe Biden, has said online instruction is probably needed for a little while longer.  Even some of Trump’s fellow Republicans have dismissed his heavy-handed push to reopen schools. Related CoveragePediatricians, unions push back against pressure to reopen U.S. schoolsOhio Governor Mike DeWine on Friday said local administrators would decide the best plan for schools in his state and that much of what happens depends on people adopting face masks and other measures now.  “What we do in the fall ... is going to depend to a great extent on what we do in the next 30 days,” he told CNN.     “We’re not going to be bullied or threatened by the president,” Maryland’s Larry Hogan, another Republican governor, told MSNBC this week.

The NRL became the first professional team sport in Australia to resume competition last week and introduced strict health monitoring, which includes temperature checks for players before games. Six players from the Cronulla Sharks failed their initial temperature check before their match against North Queensland in Townsville on Saturday, but all were cleared to play following a second check 15 minutes later. Three other players failed initial checks ahead of Thursday’s game between the Sydney Roosters and Brisbane Broncos. The NRL’s head of football Graham Annesley told the Australian Associated Press on Sunday that failed repeated temperature checks would be referred to league officials. “There’s a process that kicks in immediately when we have a problem,” Annesley told AAP. “The (Australian Rugby League) Commission ultimately decides whether a game should proceed or not, or whether it should be deferred or whatever other options there might be. “There’s no one-size-fits-all solution.” Any player registering a temperature above 37.2 Celsius (98.96 Fahrenheit) is deemed to have failed the test. A faulty device was believed to have caused so many failures on Saturday. Cronulla coach John Morris jokingly admitted after his side’s 26-16 victory he was worried he might have to come out of retirement. “They were dropping like flies. It was kind of like trying to get into a nightclub when you haven’t got your ID - they were all getting turned away,” Morris told reporters. “I was like, ‘What’s going on here?

"June 17, 2020",AAP,"                German publisher Bauer sells Australia magazine business to Mercury Capital - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Private EquityJune 17, 2020 /  4:07 AM / a month agoGerman publisher Bauer sells Australia magazine business to Mercury Capital2 Min ReadJune 17 (Reuters) - German magazine and digital firm Bauer Media Group said on Wednesday its Australian arm that publishes titles, including the Australian Women’s Weekly and ELLE Australia, would be acquired by private equity firm Mercury Capital. The sale comes amid a sharp downturn in advertising revenue that has caused job losses across the media industry and forced some companies, including the Australian Associated Press (AAP), to shut down operations. The sale ends a tough eight-year Australian stint for Bauer, which started with the company acquiring ACP Magazines from Nine Entertainment for A$525 million ($360.26 million) in 2012. Bauer or Mercury did not disclose the value of the deal, but reports here suggest Bauer has sold the business for A$50 million. The acquisition is due to be completed by July-end and includes all of Bauer Media Australia’s titles, as well as Bauer’s New Zealand mastheads, the company said in its statement. Reports of acquisition by Mercury Capital emerged in November last year, weeks after Bauer bought Seven West Media Ltd’s Pacific Magazines for A$40 million. Recently, Bauer itself laid off several staff, ceased printing of many titles in Australia and shut operations in New Zealand in April, where it published titles such as New Zealand Listener and the New Zealand Woman’s Weekly. Bauer and Mercury did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the impact of the sale on jobs and operations of the parties. $1 = 1.4573 Australian dollarsReporting by Shruti Sonal in Bengaluru; Editing by RashmiAichOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

"August 30, 2019",AAT,"                Australia’s First State Super bets on domestic loans - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States FinancialsAugust 30, 2019 /  9:12 AM / a year agoAustralia’s First State Super bets on domestic loansApple Lam, Prakash Chakravarti6 Min ReadHONG KONG, Aug 30 (LPC) - Australian superannuation fund First State Super is planning to ramp up its domestic loan investments in the next two to three years, adding to the growing pool of non-bank investors as the country’s institutional investor base continues to grow. First State Super is planning to boost its domestic direct lending book to around A$2bn–$3bn (US$1.35bn–$2.03bn), the fund told Basis Point, rebalancing a A$5bn credit income portfolio that is mostly invested overseas. The strategic change comes in response to a gradual pullback in lending by domestic Australian banks as a result of higher capital requirements and recent regulatory scrutiny, including a Royal Commission into the financial sector. First State Super is poised to become Australia’s second-largest superannuation fund with about A$120bn in funds under management from 1.1m Australians after its proposed merger with Victorian Superannuation Fund, which is expected to be completed by mid-2020, further cementing its position in the Australian institutional market. “The money we gave to our managers has historically been invested internationally so from the outset, there was a desire to try and bring the centre of gravity back to Australia,” said Ross Pritchard, portfolio manager for credit income at First State Super. Pritchard joined First State Super in June 2017. Later that year the Royal Commission was set up to inquire and report on misconduct in banking, superannuation and financial services in Australia. Since joining, Pritchard has grown First State Super’s direct lending portfolio to around A$620m through 10 loans and bonds and is looking to double his team’s headcount to six in the next few months. FLEXIBLE AND DIVERSIFIED First State Super is flexible in its lending strategy and keen to build a diversified direct lending portfolio, which currently spans nine industries – healthcare, packaging, logistics, carparks, data centres, industrial real estate, childcare, transportation and retail and grocery. Nearly a quarter of its portfolio comprises exposure to the healthcare sector. Its most recent loan was a refinancing for a carparking business, to which First State Super lent A$55m alongside banks. This year the superannuation fund also joined two syndicated acquisition financings – the A$2.15bn five-year loan backing Brookfield Capital Partners’ leveraged buyout of hospital operator Healthscope, which was completed recently, and a A$405.68m five-year loan completed in July for AAT for its purchase of Transport Australia Group. The direct lending group typically invests in sub-investment grade and mid-market companies with Double B credit ratings, and has declined more than 100 loans and bonds since its inception 18 months ago. Around 80% of the transactions it has participated in so far are senior secured. “We are saying no to deals that we feel are too risky,” Pritchard said. “We do see some elements of aggressive structures in the market at the moment and we will decline such deals if we feel they exceed our risk appetite or do not offer good risk-adjusted returns.” Leveraged loans and property financings typically offer the returns First State Super is targeting. For instance, Healthscope’s LBO loan pays interest margins of 400bp over BBSY for the amortising term loan and revolver tranches and 425bp over BBSY for the bullet and capex portions. BUY-AND-HOLD STRATEGY First State Super typically lends an average A$50m−$75m, although it can consider larger commitments, and is less focused on long-term assets than many other pension funds and insurers. The average maturity of its direct lending assets is around 5.5 years. “Most Australian super funds, ourselves included, are substantially defined contributions, so there’s not the same focus on matching your calculated defined benefit liabilities,” Pritchard explained. “It’s more about achieving good risk-adjusted returns for a specific sector that you participate in.” First State Super also has a buy-and-hold strategy and does not actively trade its loans in the secondary market, although it has bought some paper to increase its exposure to existing credits. “The secondary market for credit exposures in Australia is not very deep and there are not a lot of high-yield bonds or liquid loans that you could trade. Our job is to get good returns for our members so we will always consider opportunities based on their merit, including exiting transactions, but I think our starting point would be to buy and hold,” said Pritchard. First State Super’s direct lending team has not participated in Green loans or bonds, although screening for environmental, social and governance metrics is built into its credit approval process. “We have looked at several opportunities but we haven’t invested in Green bonds, partly because such deals come from high-grade borrowers and offer lower returns,” said Mike Cowell, senior investment analyst in Pritchard’s team. “However, if they meet our return hurdles, we would be very keen to lend.” Daniel Barnett, another senior investment analyst at First State Super, added, “What are called ESG concerns are valid underwriting and due diligence concerns that need to be considered as part of any analysis regardless of whether they have the ESG label or not.” Reporting by Apple Lam and Prakash Chakravarti; Editing byChien Mi Wong and Tessa WalshOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

"December 6, 2019",AAT,"                Direct lending grows Down Under - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States HealthcareDecember 6, 2019 /  9:43 AM / 8 months agoDirect lending grows Down UnderMariko Ishikawa6 Min Read* Loans: Institutional investors expand into investment-grade financings By Mariko Ishikawa SYDNEY, Dec 6 (LPC) - Institutional investors are expanding their presence in investment-grade loans in Australia, opening up new funding options for the country’s top borrowers. The growing interest in direct lending is good news for Australian companies, as it allows them to diversify their investor base and explore longer-dated financings. In the most recent example, a A$880m (US$601.6m) seven-year loan for Walker Corp’s Paramatta Square precinct redevelopment project closed late last month, drawing first-time lenders such as AXA Investment Managers, Metlife Alico Life Insurance and IFM Investors. It followed loans a few months back for supermarket chain Woolworths, Infrastructure Capital and ERM Power’s Neerabup gas-fired power station in Western Australia and electricity network Ausgrid, all of which also attracted institutional investors. Institutional investors have been especially active in leveraged financings in recent years, allowing financial sponsors to fund acquisitions with less restrictive covenants. “In the loan market, other than in higher yielding transactions, there has been a reasonably finite pool of non-bank investors that are regularly active,” said Gavin Chappell, head of syndications Australia at ANZ. “Some of the non-bank investors particularly like businesses such as infrastructure and property, where you have got physical assets and asset security. It’s been our goal for a number of years to have more institutional investors into these transactions.” Australia’s Metrics Credit Partners and Singapore’s Eastspring Investments participated in Woolworths’ A$2bn refinancing in October, returning after their first loan deal with the company in 2016, while BlackRock Capital Investment Corp, Japan’s Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance and Daido Life Insurance came into Newgen Neerabup’s A$252m 10.25-year senior secured loan. AusGrid’s A$1.65bn loan, with seven and 10-year tenors, attracted Meiji Yasuda Life, Daido Life Insurance, Dai-ichi Life as well as Hong Kong Mortgage Corp as first time creditors in June. In contrast, AusGrid completed a A$6.93bn loan refinancing in October 2018 with 22 banks. Australia’s First State Super is planning to ramp up its domestic loan investments to up to A$3bn in the next few years. The A$90bn superannuation fund joined a A$2.15bn loan supporting Brookfield Asset Management’s leveraged buyout of Australian hospital operator Healthscope in September and a A$405m five-year loan in July for AATS Holdings’ acquisition of Transport Australia Group. “To maintain a diverse and balanced portfolio, super funds will invest across the whole capital structure,” said Chappell. “That’s very different from a specific fund (such as a debt fund) that’s set up to invest in a particular sector or asset class.” Onshore and offshore institutions have been steadily increasing their presence in leveraged loans and riskier property deals in Australia in the past few years. In some instances, institutional investors have replaced banks as lenders, stepping in to provide alternative capital to borrowers. “Some of the high-yield non-bank investors in the property market are doing transactions on terms that banks historically haven’t been comfortable with,” said Chappell. SUPPORTING ROLE In loans for high-grade borrowers – typically the preserve of commercial banks – institutional investors are more likely to play a supporting role. Nonetheless, their growing participation in financings spells a welcome development for borrowers as it would help them diversify their funding and obtain more favorable terms. The growth in liquidity available for Australian credits comes against the backdrop of pricing compression, mirroring other parts of Asia where high-grade borrowers are able to squeeze relationship banks for tightly-priced borrowings. Declining loan volumes in the past few years have added pressure on lenders as banks have chased quality credits. On a relative basis, however, lenders have maintained discipline on pricing in Australia, and high-grade loans tend to provide better returns than in other parts of Asia. Foreign banks and institutional investors have found loans from borrowers Down Under more appealing as a result, often looking beyond the Australian bank market’s traditional five-year maturity in order to improve returns. Woolworths’ loan included a seven-year tenor, the longest for the supermarket chain to date, and closed to a stupendous response from 47-strong syndicate. Chinese banks took 32% of the A$2bn refinancing, while Taiwanese and Japanese banks held 21% each. That compared with allocation of less than 6% for the domestic banks. “There are investors that want to generate a reasonable return (albeit well below that available in most high-yield markets) that want a low-risk investment,” said Sydney-based Chappell. “If you look at the returns in various other jurisdictions, Australia is still seen as a reasonably attractive place to invest.

"July 17, 2020",AB,"                Euro zone shares flat as EU recovery plan awaited; Ericsson soars - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsJuly 17, 2020 /  7:49 AM / 4 days agoEuro zone shares flat as EU recovery plan awaited; Ericsson soarsSruthi Shankar, Susan Mathew3 Min Read(Reuters) - Euro zone shares were little changed on Friday as investors awaited the outcome of an European Union summit where leaders are expected to hammer out details of a 750-billion-euro ($858 billion) recovery fund. The euro zone STOXX index .STOXXE was flat after rallying earlier this week to the highest since early June, mostly on hopes an EU-wide fund to support pandemic-struck economies could lift the bloc out of recession.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned “the differences are still very, very big,” as she arrived at the summit in Brussels. Analysts believe markets could tolerate a few days or weeks of delay, with opposition from the Netherlands and the threat of a Hungarian veto weighing on chances of a deal on the EU’s 2021-27 budget - envisaged at slightly above 1 trillion euros - and the attached recovery fund. “(Merkel’s) cautious comments suggested EU leaders might not be able to reach a compromise,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, New York. “Negotiations are expected to be tough ... but optimism is high that a breakthrough will be made at the two-day summit.” Meanwhile, the United States shattered its daily record for coronavirus infections on Thursday, raising fears of a slower recovery in the world’s largest economy. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  closed up 0.2% as gains in automakers .SXAP, commodity .SXPP and technology stocks .SX8P of more than 1% outweighed losses in banks .SX7P, energy .SXEP, travel and leisure stocks .SXTP.  For the week, the index was up 1.6% for its third straight week of gains, as reports of progress in developing a COVID-19 vaccine supported cyclical stocks. AstraZeneca (AZN.L) was the biggest boost on the pan-region index, hitting a two-month high. Russia’s wealth fund said it was set to unveil a deal with the British drugmaker to manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine being developed along with Oxford University.

Its shares posted their best one-day percentage gain in more than two years. Tobacco group Swedish Match AB (SWMA.ST) jumped 10.4% on better-than-expected quarterly profit. Among auto stocks, Daimler (DAIGn.DE) rose 4.4% after posting a smaller-than-expected operating loss in the second quarter, while truck maker Volvo AB (VOLVb.ST) rose after beating profit forecasts.

REUTERS/Issei KatoTOKYO (Reuters) - Most people in Japan are against government plans to kickstart domestic tourism with a subsidised campaign, according to newspaper surveys published on Monday, as fears grow over the number of new coronavirus cases, particularly in Tokyo. The results highlight growing concerns that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s $16 billion “Go To” campaign, set to begin on Wednesday, could spread the virus to rural parts of the country where medical systems are fragile. Broadcaster NHK said more than 500 new cases were reported nationally on Sunday, of which 188 were in Tokyo - down by about 100 from the previous day but still well above levels seen when Abe’s government in late May called an end to a state of emergency it had imposed to contain the virus. A telephone survey conducted by the Asahi newspaper found 74% of respondents were opposed to the campaign. In a similar survey by the Nikkei business daily, some 80% of respondents said it was too early to launch such a programme. Japan has not seen the kind of rapid spread of the virus that has killed tens of thousands in other countries. But Tokyo has raised its coronavirus alert to the highest level after a series of fresh highs for new cases. Under the “Go To” campaign, travellers are set to get subsidies of as much as 50% to boost tourism-reliant economies outside major population areas. With cases on the rise in the capital, the campaign - originally open to all - will now exclude people living or vacationing in Tokyo.

Summer sunshine is seen through Olympic rings displayed at Nihonbashi district in Tokyo, Japan August 5, 2019. REUTERS/Issei KatoLATEST - Uber helpful - Trouble in Tokyo MUTUAL SELF-INTEREST. The shambolic American pandemic response means opportunities big and small for businesses to help others – and themselves. Uber Technologies’ offer of free and quick contact tracing for coronavirus exposure is a case in point. The ride-hailing firm offers public-health departments worldwide a portal to track passengers and drivers suspected of being infected. That can help find others who may have been exposed, or block carriers from using Uber and spreading the disease. It’s useful, but not a huge tool in the fight. So far, there have been 560 virus-related requests globally, and 158 domestically. But finding even a few infected passengers can be useful, especially if they’re super-spreaders. In addition to health concerns, there’s another benefit for Dara Khosrowshahi’s firm. It has a history of conflict-laden relationships with local and national governments over the legalities and details of ride hailing. Currying a bit of favor with overwhelmed officials today might help Uber tomorrow. (By Robert Cyran) CORONAVIRUSES VS. OLYMPIC RINGS. Tokyo 2020 was originally due to start this week and is now set for a year’s time. The organizers have the worries of both governments and major sports organizations over Covid-19. Should delegations of athletes be slimmed down? Should spectators – whether Japanese or foreign – be allowed? If so, how can health safeguards be maintained? If not, what about ticket refunds? When do final decisions have to be made? The whole shebang is “endangered” according to the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, fewer than a quarter of Japanese people are in favor of holding the Olympics as now scheduled, according to a Kyodo News survey on Sunday. Nearly 60% of respondents expressed discontent with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s handling of the pandemic, too. And Tokyo is experiencing a Covid-19 flare-up. With an official but understated Olympics budget of $12.6 billion, it’s no surprise some might think the priority should be elsewhere. (By Richard Beales) VACCINE FRENZY. The UK is trying to create a cottage industry out of vaccines. The government has agreed to buy some 90 million doses of inoculations against Covid-19 from Germany’s BioNTech and France’s Valneva. Add those to the 100 million doses it has already ordered from AstraZeneca, and each UK citizen could get nearly three booster shots. Helpfully, the Valneva order will also create jobs at the group’s Scottish facility. Hedging your bets makes sense. It’s unclear which of the many vaccines in development will provide the best defence. AstraZeneca’s uses a chimpanzee disease to inject elements of Covid-19 into the body. BioNTech’s introduces coronavirus genes into human cells, while Valneva’s uses an inactivated virus. But there is not a single vaccine in development that can prevent the disease from being transmitted, which may cause even inoculated people to stay home, hurting the economy. Given the probable slow recovery, creating jobs has a certain logic. (By Aimee Donnellan) PANDEMIC TWIST. The pandemic may offer EssilorLuxottica an excuse to lower the cost of its toppy GrandVision purchase. The 53 billion-euro eyewear giant agreed last year to buy the Dutch retailer for about 7 billion euros. As with other pre-virus cash deals, that price now looks inflated. And the European Commission may make the takeover even less appealing by demanding big store sales. This may be why the Ray-Ban maker sued its target on Friday, accusing it of breaching a deal pact by not fully disclosing how it’s fighting the emergency. GrandVision rejects the claims. But it’s recovering more slowly than U.S. peers, says Bryan, Garnier & Co. And its net debt is fast approaching a cap of 993 million euros agreed when the deal was struck, potentially requiring top investor HAL to inject cash. With the risk of a second pandemic wave rising, the temptation for EssilorLuxottica to haggle for a lower price will grow. (By Lisa Jucca) DIGGING OUT OF A HOLE. It’s a bad time to be an oilfield-services company. The slump in both demand for fossil fuels as well as the lower price of black gold has brought the market for drill bits, cement and the like to a virtual halt. Shares in Halliburton are down more than 40% this year, worse than Big Oil firms Exxon Mobil and Chevron. But second-quarter results on Monday show Halliburton Chief Executive Jeff Miller playing a bad hand better than expected. The company still lost $1.7 billion in the three months to the end of June. But Miller has cut costs faster than analysts expected, allowing Halliburton to generate cash rather than burn it. That was past due; Halliburton was losing money even before the virus and Saudi Arabia-Russia oil-price war hit. Miller’s next trick is to prove he has done enough to return Halliburton to profit when demand improves. (By Antony Currie) PANDEMIC JITTERS. Julius Baer made hay in the first half of the year. The Swiss private banking group on Monday reported net profit of 491 million Swiss francs over that period, up 43% from a year earlier, thanks to frenetic trading by rich clients. Boss Philipp Rickenbacher said the second half could be challenging. If market activity were to fall back to pre-pandemic levels, the bank would struggle to make decent profit on managing client assets while interest rates remain ultra-low. The poor performance of asset management Kairos has also been dragging down Julius Baer’s advisory fees. The Covid-19 pandemic is not yet under control in several countries. And there are growing fears that a new wave of infection may be on its way. U.S. elections in November and global tensions surrounding China could also make asset prices more volatile. But as the first half showed, if markets jitters come back, Julius Baer may again benefit. (By Lisa Jucca) STRONG PROGNOSIS. Frans van Houten, chief executive of healthcare-kit specialist Koninklijke Philips, was finally able to deliver some good news about the patient’s progress on Monday. After a dire second quarter, in which hospitals paused non Covid-19 equipment orders and sent Philips’ sales down 6% year-on-year, he sees signs of life. Orders, which will be booked as revenue in future quarters, were 27% higher than a year earlier. And it’s not just ventilators: Hospitals want more specialist scanners too, van Houten said. That pushed Philips’ shares up by almost 4%, taking its market value to a record 41 billion euros. The rally may have further to go. It’s likely that governments and hospitals will raise spending after the pandemic, scarred by images of overcrowded intensive-care units. Selling equipment such as patient monitors may be the new shovels in a gold rush. (By Liam Proud) ANYWHERE BUT THERE. Japan is following through on its plan to encourage some companies to reshore production from China, starting with makers of facemasks. The total subsidy, at around $536 million, won’t go very far when spread around 57 companies. That suggests Tokyo is aware of the unattractive economics of companies moving back home where the minimum hourly wage is three times higher than in core Chinese manufacturing provinces. In addition, 30 companies are being paid to move out of China into Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, where labour costs are lower. A shift to these neighbouring countries sounds more realistic. Either way, it’s one thing to help companies invest in their home economy for critical medical equipment. It’s another to pay firms to evacuate from the People’s Republic for a third location. Relations between Tokyo and Beijing have been cooling, and this will add to the frost.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Swiss power technology and automation group ABB is seen at the Swiss Economic Forum (SEF) conference in Interlaken, Switzerland May 24, 2019. REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannThe Swiss engineering group said on Wednesday it planned to start the buyback after its second quarter results on July 22 and that it would ask shareholders at next year’s annual meeting to approve cancelling the repurchased shares.  ABB received an estimated $7.6–$7.8 billion from the sale of an 80.1% stake in Power Grids, which it completed as planned by the end of June. The company plans to buy back around 180 million shares, which at Wednesday’s share price would cost 3.93 billion Swiss francs ($4.15 billion). Decisions on what to do with the remaining money will come at the company’s next AGM, in March 2021. “We are planning a multi-stage approach for how we deal with the cash from the sale of the Power Grids business to Hitachi,” an ABB spokesman said. “There will be a clear focus on returning cash to shareholders and optimising our capital structure,” he added. The company’s shares, which have lost nearly 9% this year, were up more than 2% after the announcement.  New Chief Executive Bjorn Rosengren said the sale meant ABB was now able to focus more on industrial customers and implementing a decentralised business model. ABB, which makes products ranging from factory robots to electric vehicle chargers, will keep a 19.9% holding in Power Grids, a business with revenues of $10 billion and 36,000 employees.  The Swiss company has a predefined option to exit its stake in three years time.

FILE PHOTO: Former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn talks during an interview with Reuters in Beirut, Lebanon January 14, 2020. REUTERS/Mohamed AzakirAt a Wednesday hearing in Boston, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani said she was “anticipating” denying expedited bail to Michael Taylor and Peter Taylor, who are being housed at the suburban Norfolk County Correctional Center, but would revisit the matter in late July. The Taylors, who were arrested on May 20, have argued they should be freed because of defects in their arrest warrants and requests they be extradited to Japan. They have also said 36 inmates and staff have tested positive for COVID-19 at their jail, and Michael Taylor, a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran, faced an elevated risk because part of his left lung had been removed. Ghosn had been under house arrest in Japan on financial crimes charges until late December, when he was smuggled in a large black box to a private jet and flown to Beirut, his childhood home. Lebanon has no extradition treaty with Japan. Prosecutors on Tuesday said Ghosn wired $862,500 to a company co-managed by Peter Taylor two months before the escape. At Wednesday’s hearing, federal prosecutor Stephen Hassink said the Taylors’ multiple property and familial ties to Lebanon justified their detention. “These two defendants present probably the greatest risk not only of fleeing, but also being successful in that flight that I’ve certainly seen in my time arguing for detention,” Hassink said. Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for the Taylors, countered that jail was too great a health risk. “I am not going to be the Dr. Fauci telling Mr. Hassink what the risks are” of incarceration, Lowell said, referring to top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci. “What we do know is that prisons have been incubators.”  Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Leslie AdlerOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

FILE PHOTO: Hiroaki Nakanishi, chairman of Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) and Executive Chairman of Hitachi Ltd. speaks during an interview with Reuters in Tokyo, Japan June 22, 2020. Picture taken June 22, 2020.  REUTERS/Issei KatoThe change reflects Hitachi’s transformation from a hardware-focused manufacturer into a services business and highlights the realisation that for many Japanese firms old-school human resources practices aren’t practical. The 110-year old conglomerate also needs to align pay at home with its overseas operations, which now account for more than half of its 310,000 global workforce after the $7 billion merger with ABB Ltd’s power grid business this month. But first it will lay out job descriptions for its domestic workforce and use those as criteria for performance assessments that will eventually link to pay.     Seniority-based pay made sense when the factory floor was the main training ground and new hires were taught to produce TVs, displays and chips from scratch, Chairman Hiroaki Nakanishi said in an interview.  “That model no longer works,” he said. The company ditched the bulk of its hardware-device business following the 2008 global economic crisis and now Hitachi is focused on infrastructure and related digital services. In those areas, employees need to create business ideas. Japanese firms including Hitachi have partially adopted merit pay for some employees, but labour experts say seniority-based pay remains the norm. “This is half a step forward for Japan embracing merit pay,” said Hajime Ohta, a professor of organization studies at Doshisha University professor, adding the lack of clear job roles has hampered full adoption.  Hidenobu Nakahata, Hitachi’s chief human resources officer said the company expects to find “a considerable number of people in mismatching positions”. Low labour mobility in Japan could be an issue, but Nakahata said Hitachi’s 150,000-strong job pool in Japan will allow reshuffling without layoffs. Other firms have taken note. Fujitsu Ltd (6702.T) is moving  in a similar direction, saying it will introduce job descriptions. But Keiichiro Hamaguchi, research director general at the Japan Institute for Labour Policy and Training, said many manufacturers would be reluctant to adopt job descriptions for their blue-collar workers since it would tie them to a specific process though most can perform a wide range of tasks. That flexibility on the factory floor has been a pillar of Japan Inc.  “Tech companies like Hitachi have been frontrunners in this because the manufacturing part of their business has already been sold or gone to contractors,” he said. “But do Japanese automakers really want to introduce a system similar to General Motors or Chrysler for factory workers?”  Reporting by Makiko Yamazaki; Editing by David Dolan and Christian SchmollingerOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The fingerprick tests, which can tell within 20 minutes if a person has ever been exposed to the coronavirus, were found to be 98.6% accurate in secret human trials held in June, the newspaper reported. It added the test was developed by the UK Rapid Test Consortium (UK-RTC), a partnership between Oxford University and leading UK diagnostics firms. Britain’s only antibody tests approved thus far have involved blood samples being sent to laboratories for analysis, which can take days, The Telegraph said. Anticipating a regulatory approval in the coming weeks, tens of thousands of prototypes have already been manufactured in factories across the United Kingdom, the report added. Ministers are hoping that the AbC-19 lateral flow test will be available for use in a mass screening programme before the end of the year, the newspaper reported. “It was found to be 98.6 per cent accurate, and that’s very good news,” Chris Hand, the leader of the UK-RTC, was quoted as saying by The Telegraph. “We’re now scaling up with our partners to produce hundreds of thousands of doses every month”, Hand said, adding the government’s health department is in talks with UK-RTC over buying millions of tests before the year ends. The tests are likely to be free and would be ordered online instead of being sold in supermarkets, according to plans cited by the newspaper. “While these tests will help us better understand how coronavirus is spreading across the country, we do not yet know whether antibodies indicate immunity from reinfection or transmission,” a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman was quoted as telling the newspaper.

FILE PHOTO: A 3-D printed figures are seen in front of displayed Tik Tok logo in this picture illustration taken November 7, 2019. Picture taken November 7, 2019. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File PhotoOwned by Bytedance, TikTok opened an office in Australia in recent weeks.  Offices of both the Home Affairs and Attorney-General are discussing TikTok’s operations, the sources said. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his government was “having a good look” at TikTok, which has also fallen under U.S. scrutiny for “national security risks”. “If we consider there is a need to take further action than we are taking now, then I can tell you we won’t be shy about it,” Morrison told Melbourne radio station 3AW on Friday. Separately, Labor Senator Jenny McAllister, the chairwoman of a parliamentary inquiry into foreign interference through social media, has identified TikTok as needing further scrutiny, noting 1.6 million young Australians used the app. “Some of these approaches to moderating content might be inconsistent with Australian values,” she told ABC radio. “For example, removing material about Tiananmen Square, or deprioritising material about Hong Kong protests,” she added, referring to student protests in Beijing in 1989 and pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong over the past year. Two of the three directors of the new Australian TikTok operation are senior executives of Chinese parent company ByteDance, company records seen by Reuters show. TikTok Australia general manager Lee Hunter, who was recruited from Google in June, has written to Australian politicians saying TikTok was “being used as a political football”. It was “critical you understand that we are independent and not aligned with any government, political party or ideology”, the letter said, adding TikTok Australia’s data was stored securely in Singapore and the United States.

The FBI’s Newark office said in a statement that attorney Roy Den Hollander was the sole suspect in the attack on the North Brunswick, New Jersey, home of Esther Salas that killed her 20-year old son and left her husband with gunshot wounds.  Hollander was found earlier on Monday in an apparent suicide about 90 miles (145 km) north of New York City, the Daily Beast and other media reported, citing law enforcement sources. While the motive for the shooting remained unclear, Hollander had once had a case in front of the judge and had published an online screed filled with misogynistic and racist remarks in which he derided her ethnicity and career. Related CoverageAnti-feminist lawyer is suspect in killing of judge's son: sourceSuspect in shooting of New Jersey federal judge's son found dead, ABC News saysThe attack occurred Sunday evening. Investigators say a man dressed in a FedEx uniform approached the home and opened fire, killing the son, Daniel Anderl, and injuring her husband, 63-year-old defense attorney Mark Anderl. Salas, who was in the basement, was not hurt. Salas, 51, was nominated to her position by President Barack Obama in 2010 and in the following year became the first Latina to serve on the District Court of New Jersey, a seat from which she presided over a number of high-profile cases. Those cases included the sentencing of members of the Grape Street Crips, a gang charged with selling drugs and other crimes in 2015, and the convictions of co-stars of “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” reality TV show. She also presided over a 2015 case brought by a New Jersey woman seeking to register for the male-only military draft. Hollander appeared for the plaintiff before being replaced in June 2019, court records show.

REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz It is not clear if that case was connected to the shooting in any way. In 2019 Salas ruled the lawsuit against the Selective Service System could go forward, raising the prospect of a future change to the draft. Yet in more than 2,000 pages of writings online Hollander disparaged Salas’ ethnicity and dismissed her achievements as the product of affirmative action. “Female judges didn’t bother me as long as they were middle age or older black ladies,” he wrote. Latina judges, on the other hand, were driven by an inferiority complex and “usually trouble,” he said. It also included some violent references. In advising on the merits of carrying a firearm, he wrote: “When a lunatic shows up with a gun, what do you want for a defense—PC ideology or a six-shooter?”  Hollander’s body was found in a car in the town of Rockland, New York on Monday, ABC News reported. A FedEx package addressed to Salas was discovered in the car, ABC News said. Mark Anderl is in stable condition after undergoing surgery at a local hospital, North Brunswick Mayor Francis Womack said.     Slideshow (4 Images)The son was an aspiring lawyer who was a student at Catholic University in Washington, D.C. He had just finished celebrating his 20th birthday with visiting university friends, according to Marion Costanza, a family friend who lives three houses away. “Now they are never going to see him again,” Costanza said. “I want people to know what a good kid he was.” New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and U.S. Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey were among political leaders who expressed concern about the incident on Twitter. Menendez said he knew Judge Salas well and had recommended her appointment to the federal bench. “My prayers are with Judge Salas and her family, and that those responsible for this horrendous act are swiftly apprehended and brought to justice,” Menendez wrote.

"March 6, 2020",ABG,"                Norwegian Air shares hit as travel slump puts liquidity on radar - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsMarch 6, 2020 /  11:31 AM / 5 months agoNorwegian Air shares hit as travel slump puts liquidity on radarNerijus Adomaitis, Izabela Niemiec4 Min ReadOSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Air’s (NWC.OL) shares lost a quarter of their value on Friday on concerns about its ability to weather a dramatic drop in global travel as the coronavirus spreads. FILE PHOTO: Norwegian Air Sweden Boeing 737-800 plane SE-RRJ taxies to take-off in Riga International Airport in Riga, Latvia January 17, 2020. REUTERS/Ints Kalnins/File PhotoPareto Securities cut its rating on the airline’s stock, saying it was concerned about weak cash reserves and the risk that it may have to issue new shares to shore up its finances. ABG Sundal Collier also cut its rating on the stock, from hold to sell, saying the firm was low on cash and in danger of breaching its loan covenants in the second quarter of 2020.  Norwegian Air said on Friday it had sold over two-thirds of its available seats for March and that the situation was “challenging” and “changing constantly”. Analysts have warned that Norwegian, which has expanded the low-cost carrier model to long-haul flights, could be particularly vulnerable due to its high debts. ABG Sundal Collier forecasts Norwegian will have a cash balance at the end of the first quarter of 1.2 billion crowns and at the end of the second quarter of 0.9 billion crowns.  “Too low, in our view. This means we expect Norwegian to raise new equity,” it said. The airline has already raised 5.4 billion Norwegian crowns via three share issues in two years, as well as a convertible bond, to help shore up its finances. The airline’s shares hit a 15-year low on Friday, down 95% from their 2015 peak, and the company’s market capitalisation is now 1.95 billion Norwegian crowns ($211 million). Debts and liabilities amounted to 81.2 billion Norwegian crowns ($8.79 billion) at the end of 2019, while cash and cash equivalents stood at 3.1 billion crowns. In 2018, Norwegian rebuffed takeover offers from British Airways’ parent company IAG ICAG.OL, which has since said it was no longer interested in buying the ailing carrier. Norwegian’s convertible bonds have so-called covenants linked to the finances of a key subsidiary, Arctic Aviation Assets (AAA), which must keep its book equity and debt levels within certain minimum levels. ABG expects a book equity at the end of the first quarter of 1.56 billion crowns, just above the bond covenant of 1.5 billion crowns, unless the airline can make a profit from the planned sale of an aircraft. At the end of the second quarter, “we see Norwegian Air breaching covenants on our numbers,” ABG said. Norwegian scrapped its 2020 earnings outlook and cut some transatlantic flights on Thursday, blaming the coronavirus outbreak. At 1454 GMT, Norwegian Air’s shares were down 23.7% at 12.06 Norwegian crowns ($1.30). The stock has fallen almost 70% since the start of February, making it the hardest hit among European airlines, as the virus spread to Europe and the United States, forcing airlines to cut flights and costs and warn of a hit to earnings. “There is clearly a risk for all the airlines, but we see Norwegian with a slim cash buffer perhaps at a (bigger) risk,” Pareto Securities analyst Kenneth Sivertsen told Reuters, pointing out that it may require new equity.

"May 4, 2020",ABG,"                Zoom rival Pexip launches lockdown listing with video roadshow - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Internet NewsMay 4, 2020 /  6:54 AM / 3 months agoZoom rival Pexip launches lockdown listing with video roadshowAbhinav Ramnarayan4 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Norway’s Pexip announced virtual roadshows on Monday in a step towards becoming the first European company to complete an initial public offering (IPO) remotely, as it looks to build on demand for video-conferencing due to the coronavirus crisis. Pexip, which rivals video conferencing software such as Zoom and BlueJeans and says it is used by the U.S. military and the German government, may blaze a trail for others, bankers said. A combination of turbulent markets due to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the logistical hurdles of conducting a deal remotely during lockdowns in most of the world has deterred companies from launching IPOs.    But in a rare example of a firm going ahead with a listing during the crisis, Pexip intends to sell 17 million new shares at 63 Norwegian crowns ($6.06) each. Existing shareholders plan to sell another 17 million shares at the same price, taking the total to be raised in the IPO to 2.142 billion crowns. IPOs usually involve analysts, bankers and company executives jet-setting around the world for presentations at high-end hotels and face-to-face meetings with investors. “We initially had some pushback about completing the deal on video, but this lockdown period is a big change for society as a whole and we believe for the finance industry and for IPOs it is a super efficient way of doing interactive meetings,” Pexip Chief Executive Odd Sverre Ostlie told Reuters on Friday.  Ostlie admitted, however, that the market volatility had scared him a bit, but “massive interest” since Pexip first announced its intention to list last week helped soothe nerves.  As the working world has rushed to video-conferencing systems since the crisis erupted, their security systems have come under scrutiny. Pexip markets itself as being more secure than rivals by allowing users to store the data on a “self host” basis on their own private cloud or data centre. Funds advised by Capital Research and Management Company, Wasatch Global Investors, DNB Asset Management and TIN Fonder have committed to subscribe to 1 billion crowns of shares in the IPO. “We did the very first early look meetings back in January and February live, then we switched to all video meetings,” said Peter Straume, managing partner and chief executive of ABG Sundal Collier Norway, one of the joint global coordinators along with Carnegie and Pareto Securities.  “The company has for example never met the two U.S. based cornerstone investors face-to-face, all interaction with them have been done by video,” he added.  OTHER POTENTIALS Market participants are keeping a close eye on proceedings and trying to glean what the deal might mean for other potential issuers. With IPOs drying up, equity capital markets (ECM) bankers are focusing on running secondary trades for companies looking to raise funds to get through a global recession.  But bankers say that a small pipeline of deals is building in Europe, especially in the Nordic region. In the United States, pharma companies Zentalis Pharmaceuticals and Keros Therapeutics completed IPOs last month. “I suspect that in most IPOs when investors need to make substantial investments they will still want to meet management - but that can change,” said a London-based banker who heads equity capital markets for a bulge bracket bank. He said he would be keeping a close eye on the Pexip trade.      Roadshows for Pexip will run from May 5 to May 12, though timing may be extended up until May 19 if necessary, the company said in a statement to the Norwegian bourse.

The shares rose to 97 Norwegian crowns at 0710 GMT, up from 63 crowns in a sale of new and existing stock that concluded on Tuesday, now valuing the company at about 9.6 billion Norwegian crowns ($942 million). Pexip, which competes with the likes of Zoom and BlueJeans and says it is used by the U.S. military and the German government, has registered a jump in demand for its services since the start of the novel coronavirus crisis.  Its offer of 38 million new and existing shares had amounted to 2.39 billion crowns, but investor interest in the stock had exceeded 30 billion crowns, Pexip said. Taking advantage of its own technology, Pexip conducted an all-virtual roadshow as it sought to become the first European company to complete an IPO remotely. As businesses rushed to video-conferencing during the COVID-19  outbreak, security of such services has come under increasing scrutiny. Pexip, however, markets itself as being more secure than rivals by allowing users to store data on a “self host” basis on private cloud or data centres. A so-called over-allotment option could allow Pexip to issue up to four million additional shares via advisers ABG Sundal Collier, Carnegie and Pareto Securities on top of its current 99 million shares, further raising the company’s overall value.

The firm said it had entered into a “stalking horse asset purchase agreement” with SPARC Group LLC, which owns brands such as Aeropostale and Nautica, for the sale of “substantially all” its operating assets. Such a pact sets a starting bid or minimally accepted offer as a threshold for other potential buyers if they want to bid. Lucky Brand estimated both assets and liabilities in the range of $100 million to $500 million, its filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of Delaware showed. “The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted sales across all channels,” the firm’s interim chief executive, Matthew Kaness, said in the statement.  “While we are optimistic about the reopening of stores and our customers’ return, the business has yet to recover fully.” ABG-Lucky, a newly-formed unit of Authentic Brands Group, the brand manager which bought Barneys New York out of bankruptcy, will buy the intellectual property of Lucky Brand, the statement added. The company said it had received new financing commitments from some existing lenders to ensure enough liquidity to fund the business through the closing of the sale.  The statement did not specify the amount of commitments received, adding that the company would operate its business during the Chapter 11 process. Lucky Brand, founded in Los Angeles in 1990, joins a growing roster of apparel retailers pushed towards bankruptcy by the virus. J Crew Group, JC Penney and Neiman Marcus each filed for bankruptcy in May.

"October 15, 2019",ABM,"                Mexico's Senate aims to pass bills cutting bank fees by end-October: MORENA - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsOctober 15, 2019 /  5:58 PM / 9 months agoMexico's Senate aims to pass bills cutting bank fees by end-October: MORENADiego Oré3 Min ReadMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s Senate aims to pass a first raft of bills to regulate fees for financial services by the end of October, said Ricardo Monreal, Senate leader of the ruling National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party. Mexico's Senator Ricardo Monreal speaks during the delivery of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) deal, at the Senate building in Mexico City, Mexico May 30, 2019. REUTERS/Henry RomeroLast November, shortly before President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office, MORENA lawmakers presented a bill to limit bank fees, sparking an investor backlash that pummeled the peso MXN=, Mexico's S&P/BMV IPC stock index and banking shares. The bill, which is sponsored by Monreal, has since then been wrapped up in negotiations with Mexico’s central bank, the finance ministry and Mexico’s banking association (ABM). In “two weeks (we’ll) pass an initial package of initiatives,” Monreal said in an interview with Reuters on Monday. “We’re going step by step,” he added, saying the first group of bills would change 32 articles and three laws. If approved by the Senate, the package would pass to the lower house. MORENA and its allies hold big majorities in both. The planned changes mostly relate to transparency and including more Mexicans in the banking system, which is in banks’ interest, Monreal said. “There is resistance,” he added. “But I think (banks) have understood ... they must reduce these sorts of charges,” a reference to fees in general. His plan includes a proposal that banks exempt accounts smaller than 18,700 pesos ($970) from certain fees, as well as free up such accounts from other charges. A study by financial products watchdog Condusef said 30% of Mexican banks’ revenue on average comes from their fees, which Monreal called “among the highest in the world.” The ABM represents banks such as BBVA (BBVA.MC), Santander (SAN.MC), the Mexican unit of Citigroup (C.N), Grupo Financiero Banorte (GFNORTEO.MX), and billionaire Carlos Slim’s Grupo Financiero Inbursa (GFINBURO.MX).  Separately, Monreal, a 59-year-old veteran of Mexican politics, said Congress will by Oct. 20 approve a proposal to apply a value-added tax on digital businesses. The VAT rate at Mexico currently stands at 16%.    Under the initiative, companies such as Amazon (AMZN.O), Uber (UBER.N) or Google (GOOGL.O), will be responsible for paying the tax, the senator said. “They have to pay without hitting the consumer. From what they make now,” he said. “It would be very easy to charge the consumer for it. They have to absorb it as part of their costs.” The initiative also obliges platforms such as Netflix (NFLX.O) to produce at least 30% worth of their Mexico programing within the country, said Monreal.

"March 19, 2020",ABM,"                America's cleaners: fighting on the coronavirus front line - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States U.S.March 19, 2020 /  2:03 PM / 4 months agoAmerica's cleaners: fighting on the coronavirus front lineJonnelle Marte7 Min ReadNEW YORK (Reuters) - It’s been roughly two weeks since Amazon (AMZN.O) encouraged most employees at its Seattle headquarters to work remotely after one tested positive for coronavirus. Larrilou Carumba, a cleaner who works in hotels, takes a selfie with her family as they shelter in a place in San Francisco, California, U.S., that is currently in lockdown due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in the city March 17, 2020. Larrilou Carumba/Handout via REUTERSSince then, Ismahan Ali and other janitors who clean the tech giant’s offices say they have been getting paid to work overtime to wipe down stairwells, conference rooms and other high-traffic areas.  Ali, 29, doesn’t clean the building where the infected Amazon employee worked, but she shares a break room with some janitors who do. So every cough or sneeze is a reminder that coronavirus could be lingering on a surface they’ve cleaned, or that one may already have been exposed, she said.  “Everyone is scared,” said Ali, who works for ABM, a maintenance and cleaning firm that employs more than 140,000 people. “We just keep going, let’s do what we can.” For the three million janitors, housekeepers and maids across America, remote working is not an option. They are on the front line of the war against the virus, often working overnight and weekends to deep clean offices, airports and hotels. Ali said at first she was not used to the stronger cleaning product she was asked to use as part of an enhanced cleaning protocol put in place because of the virus. The chemical irritated her eyes, throat and skin, but she has since been provided with goggles and a mask, which she said is helping. ABM did not respond to multiple emails and phone calls requesting comment.  A spokeswoman for Ali’s union, Service Employees International Union Local 6, said ABM had been responsive to its concerns and has committed to providing janitors with more protective gear and training. A janitor with experience of using stronger chemicals is also now providing guidance to other staff at Amazon, the union representative said. Amazon said safety was a top priority and that it had notified employees and service providers, including janitors, who may have been in close contact with its employee who tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Amazon also said it was committed to paying hourly workers who cannot come to work because of coronavirus. “We continue to pay all hourly employees that support our offices around the world – from food service, to security guards to janitorial staff – during the time our employees are asked to work from home,” an Amazon representative said in a statement.  ‘PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK’ Other cleaning professionals have seen demand for their services dry up as major events are canceled, malls and movie theaters close, and business travel is put on hold. Those working in the hospitality and entertainment industry have been hit hard, with lost wages adding a new layer of uncertainty to their already precarious financial lives.  Earlier this month, Larrilou Carumba, a 47-year-old housekeeper at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis hotel, applied to rent a two-bedroom apartment.  But then she got her work schedule: she wasn’t needed for at least two weeks. Suddenly unsure of when her next paycheck would land, she withdrew her application.  “I’m more afraid about my bills than the coronavirus,” she said, adding that she would struggle to afford groceries, her car payments and insurance, and other outgoings. “Being a single mom, you live paycheck to paycheck.”     Janitors earned a median hourly wage of $12.55 in 2018 while housekeepers made $11.43. Low-wage workers without unions are also less likely to have fundamental health benefits, including health insurance or sick leave, according to surveys from the Economic Policy Institute. Think-tank Pew Research Center estimates here more than a third of cleaners and maintenance workers in America are immigrants. “I’m going to keep cleaning because I have to help my family,” said Ali, who is studying to become a nurse and sends money to her family in Somalia. “I don’t have a choice to stay home. I have to go.” ‘FALLING OFF A CLIFF’ Hotel companies are reeling from a sharp drop in business over the past couple of weeks as conferences are canceled, vacations scrapped and casinos shut down.  Occupancies in the second week of March were 24.4% lower than the same week last year, according to data firm STR. Of the 25 markets it studied, the San Francisco region reported the second biggest hit to occupancy, which fell by 51.6% from 2019.  “Our industry is falling off a cliff,” said D. Taylor, president of the UNITE HERE, a union that represents about 300,000 members in the hotel, gaming, food, transport and other service industries in the United States and Canada. Taylor said hospitality workers were under significant  pressure as schools close, and traffic at hotels, casinos and airports plummets. He is advocating for more workers to receive paid sick leave so they can afford to stay home if they are unwell, or need to be quarantined.  For people who are laid off, the union is pushing for fast access to unemployment benefits and extended access to health insurance. “The coronavirus is a pretty scary thing and often our folks are on the front lines,” Taylor said. Marriott International (MAR.O) said a significant drop in demand worldwide was forcing it take remedial measures. “Unfortunately, occupancy dictates staffing levels - we are adjusting global operations accordingly and working quickly to mitigate the impact to our business,” it said in a statement.  U.S. regulators and lawmakers are considering different options that could provide relief to low-income workers affected by the pandemic, including leniency with loans, expanding unemployment benefits and providing other financial assistance.

Picture taken October 11, 2019. Unite Here, Local 2/Handout via REUTERSAfter withdrawing her bid for the apartment, Carumba submitted a different application - for unemployment benefits.  She is still waiting to hear whether she will get any assistance until she can return to work. “I have a strong faith that this will end,” she said. “I just don’t know when.” Reporting by Jonnelle Marte; Editing by Heather Timmons and David ClarkeOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

"March 19, 2020",ABM,"                Bankers quarantined after Mexico hosts convention despite coronavirus threat - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States World NewsMarch 19, 2020 /  11:48 PM / 4 months agoBankers quarantined after Mexico hosts convention despite coronavirus threatAnthony Esposito, Abraham Gonzalez3 Min ReadMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Many of Mexico’s top banking and financial brass are under quarantine or having to work from home after having attended an annual industry bash at a Pacific getaway last week where at least one participant later tested positive for coronavirus. In contrast to much of Latin America, Mexico’s government has so far taken a hands-off approach to tackling the fast-spreading virus, letting large-scale events go ahead, including the swanky banking conference in the beach resort of Acapulco and a music festival in Mexico City. Then a high-ranking official at Mexico’s central bank tested positive after participating in the convention, which was also attended by the president, finance minister and hundreds of senior bankers. “Citibanamex attendees at the Banking Convention are in quarantine and working from home. None of them have presented any symptoms related to coronavirus,” said a spokesman for Citigroup Inc’s (C.N) Mexican operations Citibanamex. The Mexican Banking Association (ABM) defended its decision to go ahead with the convention, saying measures had been put in place to safeguard participants’ safety.  In fact, conference organizers set up tables, stocked with hand sanitizers, along hallways, while hostesses offered hand gel and signs detailed the sanitary measures. But despite calls for social distancing, the convention was a potential hotbed for transmission as Mexicans found it hard to shake the habit of greeting friends, family and even strangers with a handshake, hug or kiss on the cheek. After the Banco de Mexico statement that one of its high-level officials tested positive for the flu-like virus, the ABM and a significant number of banks instructed those who attended the convention to work remotely for the next 15 days. HSBC said it sent a small group of people to the convention, and that its executives are now also working from home. Santander Mexico (SAN.MC) said half its personnel from its corporate offices are working from home, and Grupo Financiero Banorte (GFNORTEO.MX) said that part of its employees were doing the same. The overall number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Mexico rose by 27% in the 24 hours through Wednesday afternoon to 118 from 93 a day earlier. The country registered its first death from coronavirus, a 41-year-old diabetic Mexican man whose symptoms began last week, the health ministry said late on Wednesday.

The U.S. Commerce Department said on Wednesday it is addingHuawei and 70 affiliates to its so-called ""Entity List"" — a movethat bans the telecom giant from buying parts and componentsfrom U.S. companies without a government approval.    ""Trump is moving to curb Huawei's access to the U.S. marketand American suppliers. This can be taken negatively withregards to how the Trump administration plans to ease tensionsbetween the two largest economies in the world,"" Fio Dejesus,equity research analyst at RCBC Securities, said.      Philippine stocks fell almost 1% to their lowestsince Jan. 3, pressured by energy and consumer cyclicals.    The Philippines, an ally of the United States, in February,pushed ahead to launch a Huawei Technologies-backed 5G servicein the country, even as Washington said it would rethinkcooperation with allies that use Huawei.    Malaysia stocks marginally slipped ahead of itsfirst quarter gross domestic product (GDP) data, which isexpected to grow at a much slower pace than the previousquarter, according to a Reuters poll.    Top losers on the index were synthetic rubber gloves makerHartalega Holdings, which saw its worst day inone-week and Malaysia Airports Holdings, which dropped1.4%.        Indonesia's index edged lower ahead of centralbank's policy decision later in the day, as the apex bank isexpected to keep its benchmark interest rates unchanged afterthe country posted its widest monthly trade deficit inhistory.    Mall operator Bliss Properti Indonesia slumpednearly 19%, while engineering services company ABM Investama dropped to a record low.

"May 3, 2020",ABR,"                El Robin Hood del Vaticano ayuda a alimentar a prostitutas transexuales durante el confinamiento - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States HealthcareMay 3, 2020 /  8:23 AM / 3 months agoEl ""Robin Hood"" del Vaticano ayuda a alimentar a prostitutas transexuales durante el confinamientoPor Philip Pullella3 Min ReadCIUDAD DEL VATICANO, 30 abr (Reuters) - Cuando los confinamientos para contener la propagación del coronavirus dejaron sin trabajo a un grupo de prostitutas transexuales callejeras de un balneario cercano a Roma, ellas acudieron a un sacerdote católico local para que las ayudara a comprar alimentos. Los recursos de su parroquia, sin embargo, ya eran escasos debido a la crisis sanitaria, así que el sacerdote recurrió a un cardenal conocido como “el Robin Hood del Papa”, quien está a cargo de las caridades del Vaticano. Él transfirió dinero a la parroquia para ayudarlas. “No entiendo por qué esto está recibiendo tanta atención”, dijo el jueves el cardenal Konrad Krajewski a Reuters por teléfono. “Este es trabajo común para la Iglesia, es normal. Así es como la Iglesia es un hospital de campaña”. Krajewski, cuyo título oficial es “Limosnero papal”, o distribuidor de limosnas, dijo que las prostitutas transexuales posiblemente eran indocumentadas, lo que les hacía difícil buscar ayuda en las oficinas estatales en Italia. “Todo está cerrado. Ellas no tienen ningún recurso. Ellas fueron a su pastor. Ellas no podrían haber acudido a un político o parlamentario. Y el pastor vino a nosotros”, sostuvo. “Ellas están realmente en problemas porque algunas veces sus pasaportes les fueron arrebatados por la mafia de proxenetas que las controlan”, comentó. “Nosotros seguimos el evangelio”. Krajewski, de 56 años y uno de los cardenales más jóvenes del mundo, dijo que eso es lo que Jesús habría hecho. Y no es la primera vez que el polaco se convierte en noticia por la forma en que gestiona las caridades papales. El año pasado, descendió por una boca de acceso, rompió un sello policial y reconectó circuitos eléctricos para reponer la electricidad de cientos de personas sin hogar, muchas de ellas inmigrantes, que vivían en un edificio ocupado en Roma. Aunque Krajewski contravino al entonces ministro del Interior Matteo Salvini y sus políticas contra la inmigración, un diario italiano lo apodó “el Robin Hood del papa”. Krajewski, quien intenta evitar la atención, se ha convertido en una pequeña celebridad en Roma. Desde que el papa Francisco lo puso a cargo de las caridades en 2013, se hizo conocido por llevar alimentos a las personas sin techo de la ciudad en una camioneta blanca durante las noches. También abrió refugios cerca del Vaticano, donde las personas sin hogar se pueden bañar, cortarse el pelo y recibir atención médica.

El PMA eligió nueve aeropuertos en todo el mundo para participar en el puente aéreo humanitario especial, que también contará con hasta 350 aviones de pasajeros por mes para transportar equipos médicos y humanitarios desde principios de mayo. Un avión de carga Boeing 757 despegó del aeropuerto belga de Lieja el jueves por la noche cargado con 16 toneladas de suministros médicos, incluidas mascarillas, guantes, medicamentos y jeringas para Burkina Faso. La decisión de mantener en tierra los vuelos comerciales de pasajeros durante la pandemia no solo ha impedido el viaje de decenas de miles de trabajadores humanitarios, sino que también ha eliminado el espacio de carga. “Necesitamos capacidad para atender a muchos de los países frágiles de todo el mundo. Este puente aéreo cubrirá casi 120 países”, dijo Amer Daoudi, director de respuesta corporativa COVID-19 del PMA. Daoudi prevé que los vuelos durarán entre tres y cuatro meses, pero podrían extenderse. El puente aéreo se detendría si regresaran alternativas comerciales viables. El transporte está disponible para todos los trabajadores y cargas humanitarias de salud. Los suministros del jueves se destinaron a la agencia infantil de la ONU, UNICEF, y al Comité Internacional de la Cruz Roja (CICR) en Burkina Faso.

Cuomo anunciou as iniciativas no momento em que o Estado norte-americano mais atingido pelo surto cogita amenizar as restrições à vida social e aos negócios com um sistema de transporte público gigantesco que seja limpo e seguro para passageiros e funcionários. Ele disse que o serviço do metrô da cidade de Nova York ficará fechado entre 1h e 5h da manhã para que a Autoridade Metropolitana de Transporte, a agência que supervisiona os trens, possa pôr em ação um programa de limpeza inédito. “Este é um desafio intimidante”, disse Cuomo em entrevista diária. “Todo o sistema de transporte público do norte do Estado de Nova York será desinfetado a cada 24 horas”. O governador também detalhou planos para recrutar entre 6.400 e 17.000 pessoas de todo o Estado para tratar do rastreamento de contatos, um processo de identificação de contatos de pessoas diagnosticadas com uma doença infecciosa. Especialistas de saúde dizem que o rastreamento de contatos é essencial para se isolar pessoas potencialmente contagiosas de forma a limitar novos surtos. Cuomo disse que Michael Bloomberg, ex-prefeito da cidade de Nova York, se coordenará com a Universidade Johns Hopkins para supervisionar o recrutamento e treinamento dos rastreadores de contatos e disponibilizará o programa a governos de todo o mundo.

Em meio às diversas dificuldades físicas que a Covid-19 representa, o isolamento torna a luta contra a doença ainda mais complicada. Por isso, os profissionais do hospital instalado em um ginásio da cidade no ABC Paulista passaram a utilizar o recurso tecnológico como forma de diminuir a distância dos familiares. A voz rouca de Maria Lúcia —que preferiu não revelar o sobrenome—, bem como a máscara de oxigênio que ela é autorizada a retirar por um instante assim que uma psicóloga se aproxima com o tablet, denunciam alguns dos impactos do coronavírus. Conversar com os familiares muda seu ânimo: ela logo conta como os médicos e enfermeiros são “maravilhosos” e garante que está respirando melhor. “Eu não tinha conseguido falar ainda com a minha família, e agora, hoje, eu fiquei muito feliz, porque eu falei duas vezes”, conta ela com um sorriso. A rotina pesada em Santo André é dividida entre a alegria por pacientes que apresentam melhora e têm alta, traduzida por séries de aplausos dos próprios colegas de leitos, e a apreensão pela chegada de novas pessoas infectadas pelo coronavírus. Em meio às movimentações incessantes de profissionais da saúde na quadra esportiva ocupada por leitos, o superintendente dos hospitais de campanha de Santo André, Victor Chiavegatto, comemora o recurso encontrado para que os pacientes revejam suas famílias de forma virtual. “Ele (paciente) tem que ficar aqui, isolado do mundo — num bom tratamento, mas a gente sabe que é muito difícil ficar sozinho. Então ele pode conversar com a família nesse momento, e depois o médico liga e conversa com a família para passar o boletim médico”, disse Chiavegatto, paramentado com equipamentos de proteção. São Paulo é o primeiro Estado mais afetado pelo coronavírus no Brasil, com mais de 63 mil casos confirmados e 4.800 mortes causadas pela doença. No Brasil todo, são mais de 254 mil casos e 16,7 mil óbitos. Maria Lúcia não foi a única privilegiada em conversar com a família pelo tablet. Alguns leitos ao lado, outro que se alegra ao ver seus entes queridos é Fabiano Santana de Souza, que faz um pedido para quem está do outro lado da linha: “Guardem um pedaço de bolo.” Enquanto ele enfrenta a Covid-19 no hospital de campanha, a filha comemora 12 anos de idade em casa. O presente de Fabiano foi mostrar que, apesar da tosse seca que o acomete a cada dúzia de palavras, ele está se recuperando. “Hoje a gente conseguiu fazer essa videoconferência... Dá um alívio grande, saber que está todo mundo bem, tudo em paz. E é uma forma de eles saberem também que a gente está se recuperando”, afirmou. A alegria no rosto pela reaproximação com os familiares diante de uma situação tão difícil é também uma interferência positiva para a recuperação dos pacientes, algo que está diretamente ligado ao estado emocional de cada um deles, segundo a psicóloga Rita Calegaria, que acompanha as videoconferências. “Um dos principais sintomas da Covid é a falta de ar, então quando eles estão muito ansiosos, muito assustados, piora esse sintoma. E quando eles falam com a família, quando a família fala com eles, eles se acalmam, ficam mais otimistas, ficam mais seguros”, disse.

La iniciativa en inglés y español se realizará online debido a la pandemia de coronavirus y presentará conciertos, entrevistas y paneles que podrán seguirse en vivo bit.ly/3eDHA3b a partir de las 5 pm hora de México y Colombia, 6 pm hora del este de Estados Unidos y 7 pm hora de Argentina. El festival, que busca mostrar que la música y el talento no tienen género ni color, también presentará un video llamado “Pasa la bandera”, al que Reuters tuvo acceso, que muestra a más de 40 artistas de una decena de países como Lila Downs, Boy George y Rozalén pasándose la bandera multicolor y dando mensajes positivos como “amor es amor”, “respeto e “igualdad”. “Yo soy tú y tú eres yo. Estoy apoyando al Orgullo este año y les envío mi amor y apoyo a cada uno de ustedes (...) Celebra el amor y celebra el orgullo. Comparte el arcoiris”, dice Boy George, quien abre y cierra el video. Entre los eventos previstos se destaca la actuación de la puertorriqueña Kany García, quien cantará y participará en un episodio “especial orgullo” del podcast “La Ola”, y la entrevista a la chilena Javiera Mena, quien hablará sobre el apoyo que da a la comunidad con su música. La artista mexicana Danna Paola explicará cómo se convirtió en la reina del LGBTQIA+ de América Latina con su tema “Sodio” y los músicos Sofía Reyes y Sr Pablo darán un concierto. La influenciadora y comediante transgénero Ophelia Pastrana será la presentadora del festival virtual y guiará espacios de reflexión de artistas como las mexicanas Niña Dioz y Zemmoa en un panel llamado “La Nueva Generación”. “Para Deezer es importante celebrar el talento de los artistas, sin discriminación o prejuicios. Con este evento, reafirmamos nuestro compromiso con la inclusión, ayudando a nuestros artistas a difundir sus mensajes de tolerancia y respeto”, dijo Deborah Jourdan, jefa de América del Norte y Central de Deezer. Además del festival, Deezer lanzó un canal especial dedicado al Orgullo LGBTI+ llamado “Pride”, que incluye listas especiales de temas, que incluyen artistas como Gloria Trevi, Ricky Martin, Miranda y Pabllo Vittar, entre otros. El próximo domingo se celebra el Día Internacional del Orgullo LGBT y durante junio se realizan en todo el mundo marchas, festejos y actividades culturales, aunque este año muchas serán virtuales por la pandemia del coronavirus.

La compañía dijo que aún espera tener más de un millón de tratamientos remdesivir fabricados para diciembre, “con planes de poder producir varios millones de tratamientos en 2021”. A fines del próximo mes, Gilead dijo que debería haber fabricado más de 140.000 cursos de tratamiento del medicamento que se administra por vía intravenosa en el hospital. Se podría atender a más pacientes si se demuestra que el medicamento funciona en un período de tiempo más corto que el tratamiento estándar de 10 días, dijo Gilead. La Administración de Drogas y Alimentos de Estados Unidos dijo que ha estado en conversaciones con Gilead para poner remdesivir a disposición de los pacientes lo antes posible. Gilead también reportó ganancias estables en el primer trimestre y sus acciones caían un 2% en las operaciones fuera de la sesión regular. Los Institutos Nacionales de Salud de Estados Unidos dijeron el miércoles que los resultados preliminares de su prueba de remdesivir mostraron que los pacientes con COVID-19 que recibieron el medicamento se recuperaron un 31% más rápido que los que recibieron un placebo. En la prueba con 1.063 pacientes, los pacientes que recibieron el medicamento Gilead se recuperaron en 11 días en comparación con los 15 días de los que recibieron un placebo. Los datos de un ensayo realizado por Gilead, también presentado el miércoles, mostraron mejoras clínicas similares en pacientes con síntomas graves de COVID-19, independientemente de si recibieron cinco o diez días de tratamiento.

The field was reduced to 23 drivers after Audi sacked Daniel Abt for getting a professional gamer to race in his place in the previous live-streamed round a week ago. Mercedes driver Vandoorne has taken four poles in six races but Saturday, around a virtual Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in New York, was the first time the former McLaren F1 driver had gone on to win. Germany’s Pascal Wehrlein, the leader before the weekend, started seventh due to a penalty but recovered to finish second with Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, winner last Saturday, third. The series features regular Formula E drivers competing on simulators from their homes and aims to provide some action for fans of the all-electric championship, with racing on hold in real life due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Mahindra driver led from pole position to go 12 points clear of Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne, who was fourth for Mercedes on the New York docklands layout. The final round of the virtual all-electric season, around Berlin Tempelhof with all drivers racing from home on simulators, will be on Sunday with double points available to be won. Britain’s Oliver Rowland was second for Nissan e.dams with South African debutant Kelvin van der Linde, replacing the sacked Daniel Abt at Audi, third. Abt parted company with Audi after getting a professional gamer to take his place in race five. Former F1 driver Wehrlein revealed afterwards that he had been unable to see the start lights from his cockpit camera due to the halo and had switched to a different view which he then became stuck in for the whole race. “It was a good race, but it was one of the most difficult ones for me,” said the 25-year-old.  Britain’s Alice Powell will race in Sunday’s grand final, the only woman in the line-up, in place of Robin Frijns at Envision Virgin Racing.

Abt lost his seat last month for letting a gamer take his place, without others knowing, in an official Formula E esports race. The all-electric series has scheduled six races in nine days in August at Berlin’s former Tempelhof airport to finish a season disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The three double-headers will be held without spectators. Rast, 33, has some previous Formula E experience, racing in the 2016 Berlin ePrix for what was then the Aguri team and is now Techeetah. “I’ve been following Formula E very closely for a long time and am now looking forward to this new challenge,” said the German driver. Audi are quitting the DTM at the end of this year, opening up the possibility of Rast continuing with them in Formula E next season.

Audi Sport Abt Schaeffler's Daniel Abt celebrates with the trophy after winning the race. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer(Reuters) - Daniel Abt will return to the all-electric Formula E series with the NIO 333 team for the final six races of the season in Berlin after being sacked by Audi in May for an esports controversy. The 27-year-old German lost his real world drive after he let a gamer take his place, without the rest of the field knowing, in an official Formula E ‘Race at Home Challenge’ event. Abt, a winner in Berlin in 2018, will replace Chinese driver Ma Qinghua alongside British driver Oliver Turvey at the Chinese-owned team in the season finale behind closed doors at the old Tempelhof airport next month. China-based Ma, who has yet to score any points this season, has been ruled out by travel restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. “As the saying goes in the eastern world, ‘a prodigal who returns is more precious than gold’,” said team boss Vincent Wang in a statement on Wednesday welcoming Abt ‘with open arms’. “The controversies surrounding him during the Race at Home Challenge reached quite a high level and will bring two opposite opinions,” he added.  “In the end, after discussing with some key figures of the paddock, we have decided to give Daniel an opportunity to return to Formula E.” Abt said he would test the NIO car in Britain this month. “I have competed in every race in Formula E’s history and I have been working with a leading manufacturer for the last three years. Therefore, I have a lot of experience and input for the team,” he said.

Mayor of Warsaw and the presidential candidate of the main Polish opposition centre-right Civic Platform (PO) party Rafal Trzaskowski speaks during his election meeting in Oborniki Slaskie, Poland July 10, 2020. Krzysztof Cwik/Agencja Gazeta/via REUTERS   ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY. POLAND OUT. NO COMMERCIAL OR EDITORIAL SALES IN POLAND.AJC Central Europe, an advocacy group, pointed to a report on public broadcaster TVP’s flagship news show on Thursday that asked if opposition candidate Rafal Trzaskowski would “comply with Jewish demands”, touching on the sensitive issue of Jewish property restitution. Home to one of the world’s largest Jewish communities before World War Two, Poland is the only European Union country that has not legislated on restoring property to pre-war Jewish owners or their descendants, despite U.S. pressure. “What’s wrong with Polish public TV?... Yesterday it again warned against ‘satisfying Jewish demands’. Is that b/c you assume this hateful campaign would speak to many Poles? Think abt what message that sends,” the AJC tweeted. In a statement to Reuters, the AJC said it had been shocked by Polish public television’s use of “anti-Semitic tropes”. “It’s one thing when such messages are spread by fringe far-right groups. It’s something quite different when this is done by state TV funded with taxpayers’ money,” it said. International monitors have accused the public broadcaster of being heavily biased in its coverage of Polish politics. The public broadcaster has previously criticised Trzaskowski for suggesting, while deputy foreign minister, that Poland should negotiate with Jewish groups on property restitution. Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of the ruling Law and Justice Party, which is backing President Andrzej Duda in Sunday’s election runoff, on Thursday accused Trzaskowski of lacking patriotism for his stance on restitution. “How could anyone with even a bit of Polish soul, of Polish heart... say something like this? Trzaskowski clearly doesn’t have this as he thinks this is a matter to discuss,” Kaczynski said in an interview for Catholic broadcaster TV Trwam. Trzaskowski slammed Kaczynski’s comments on Friday. “This is exactly what this election is about - whether we will live in a country where the leader of the ruling party can say that we are trash, that we don’t have a Polish heart, a Polish soul,” Trzaskowski told supporters.

One of only a few live sports to welcome fans in North America amid the coronavirus outbreak, roaring crowds were replaced with masked, socially distanced spectators at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, where the entire three-week WTT regular season will take place. The Smash won 24-18 over the Rollers, while the Orlando Storm took down returning champions Springfield Lasers with an overall score of 21-18. Standouts for the day included 28-year-old American Tennys Sandgren, who fired off five of Orlando Storm’s eight aces, with his team winning 75% of their first-serve points.  On the Chicago team, 18-year-old Brandon Nakashima took down Sam Querrey 5-3 in the men’s singles, as teammates opted for elbow bumps over high-fives. “At the beginning I definitely was a little bit nervous,” Nakashima said on the televised broadcast. “I just tried to stay solid on the baseline on my end.” The event includes several safety measures designed to mitigate the potential spread of coronavirus, including COVID-19 testing for participants and regular temperature checks, with WTT letting a maximum of 500 fans inside the 2,500-person stadium. A Californian rivalry match between the Orange County Breakers and San Diego Aviators was expected to kick off at 8 p.m. ET on Sunday.

MONASH UNIVERSITY DEPARTMENT OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING/Handout via REUTERS SYDNEY (Reuters) - Researchers in Australia have devised a test that can determine novel coronavirus infection in about 20 minutes using blood samples in what they say is a world-first breakthrough. The researchers at Monash University said their test can determine if someone is currently infected and if they have been infected in the past. “Short-term applications include rapid case identification and contact tracing to limit viral spread, while population screening to determine the extent of viral infection across communities is a longer-term need,” the researchers said in a paper published in the journal ACS Sensors on Friday. The research team was led by BioPRIA and Monash University’s Chemical Engineering Department, including researchers from the ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent BioNano Science and Technology (CBNS). Their test, using 25 microlitres of plasma from blood samples, looks for agglutination, or a clustering of red blood cells, that the coronavirus causes. While the current swab test is used to identify people who are infected with the coronavirus, the agglutination assay - or analysis to detect the presence and amount of a substance in blood - can also determine if someone had been recently infected, after the infection is resolved, they said. Hundreds of samples can be tested every hour, the researchers said, and they hope it can also be used to detect antibodies raised in response to vaccination to aid clinical trials. A patent for the innovation has been filed and the researchers are seeking commercial and government support to scale up production. The novel coronavirus has infected more than 13.8 million people around the world and killed nearly 600,000 since it emerged in China late last year. Australia has reported more than 11,000 cases and 116 deaths.

The announcement comes a day after rival Spanish power generation company Iberdrola said its offer for Infigen Energy, due to close on July 30, was now unconditional. Infigen has asked its shareholders to reject the Ayala bid. Infigen shares closed at A$0.90 on Friday, marginally above Iberdrola’s offer as investors hoped for a higher bid to emerge from UAC Energy Holdings, a joint venture of Ayala’s AC Energy and Hong Kong-based UPC Renewables Group. Iberdrola’s offer was backed by Infigen in June after it improved its offer by 3 cents to A$0.89 a share, valuing the company at A$856 million ($598 million). The bid was approved by Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board. UAC Energy said it made no final decision regarding its stake in Infigen when its offer closes.

The U.S. earnings season kicks off this week with major Wall Street banks JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo reporting on Tuesday. It’s expected to be the second-biggest quarterly earnings drop since 1968, according to Refinitiv data. “There’s a view that the bar has been set pretty low for them to report the almost obligatory ‘better than expected’ results - the absence of forward guidance from many firms notwithstanding,” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.8% as Chinese stocks jumped 2.1% on Monday. Japan’s Nikkei gained 2.2% and South Korea 1.7%. The optimism carried over to Europe, where stocks rose 1%, even as the U.S. on Friday slapped additional duties of 25% on French luxury goods valued at $1.3 billion, in a tit-for-tat response to France’s digital services tax. MSCI’s All-Country World Index was just shy of hitting Feb. 26 highs. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 ticked 0.5% higher despite record new cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. over the weekend, a divergence that shows no sign of stopping. “Ongoing grim U.S. COVID-19 infection news continues to be summarily ignored in favour of ongoing optimism regarding the time-line for the discovery and rapid roll-out of an effective vaccine and/or more policy support for asset prices and the U.S. economy,” Attrill said. The risk-on rally saw the U.S. dollar dip 0.2% against a basket of major currencies after three straight weeks of losses. The euro, meanwhile, rose 0.2% to $1.132 to maintain its slow uptrend since late last month. Looming large for the common currency was a planned EU summit on July 17-18, where leaders need to bridge gaps on long-term budget and economic stimulus plans. “If an agreement weren’t to be reached there, then they still expect one within weeks. It’s worth remembering that there are number of complex issues to be worked out,” Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said. Safe-haven German yields rose slightly, and Italy’s 10-year yield hit the highest level in over a week at 1.33% in early trade as investors bagged profits after the recent rush to safety cooled. Yields on U.S. 10-year notes came close to record lows last week at 0.569% and were last at 0.63%. Super-low rates have in turn been a boon for non-yielding gold which hit a near nine-year high after five straight weeks of gains. The metal was last at $1,807 an ounce, just off a $1,817.17 top. The hunt for yield has tended to benefit emerging market currencies and those leveraged to commodities such as the Australian dollar, while weighing on the U.S. dollar. Oil prices eased in early trade, although that followed a sharp rise on Friday when the International Energy Agency (IEA) bumped up its 2020 demand forecast. Brent crude futures dipped 49 cents to $42.75 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost 52 cents to $40.03.

"July 3, 2020",ACC,"                Argentine creditors build 'Pac-Man' defences as country readies final offer - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsJuly 3, 2020 /  4:18 PM / 18 days agoArgentine creditors build 'Pac-Man' defences as country readies final offerMarc Jones, Jorge Iorio3 Min ReadLONDON/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina’s government is reading a final debt restructuring offer to creditors which could be formally sent to U.S. regulators within days, a government source told Reuters on Friday, even as increasingly splintered bondholders tabled another proposal of their own. FILE PHOTO: Demonstrators hold a banner that reads ""no to foreign debt payment, IMF out"" as they march towards Casa Rosada Presidential Palace during a protest against the visit of an IMF technical team to Buenos Aires, in Buenos Aires, Argentina February 12, 2020. REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian/File PhotoArgentina will present its new offer to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the coming days, according to a government source. A day earlier, a source close to the negotiations said the government was “crafting the definitive and final offer” to creditors.  Meanwhile, a new counteroffer by bondholders, which Reuters reported had been tabled on Thursday, will provide the government with $39 billion of cashflow relief over the next eight years, the Argentina Creditor Committee (ACC) said. It includes a requirement that two-thirds of bonds participate in any deal. Debt specialists see the participation threshold as important. If the government did not accept it they say it could signal an intention to adopt a so-called ‘Pac-Man’ strategy’ whereby the government tries to get investors to deal with it one at a time. “The ACC continues to believe that the best way forward is a consensual resolution,” the group said in a statement. Sources on Thursday said the new ACC offer valued bonds at around 54.5 cents on the dollar. That would be a modest drop from its previous offer of around 55-56 cents but would still be above the government’s last proposal of 50 cents plus sweeteners. The ACC added that its offer would leave creditors with a weighted average coupon of 3.95% on their bonds with a 5% maximum. Eligible bonds would also maintain their original indentures - the contract associated with the bond - meaning they would not have inferior legal guarantees. The move comes at a crucial stage in the $65 billion debt renegotiations with the Argentine government. Talks have been extended a number of times in an effort to reach a deal, though the two biggest creditor groups, the “Ad Hoc” and “Exchange” groups, which hold a combined $21 billion of the $65 billion, have complained this week of lack of engagement from the government. Sources familiar with the thinking of those two groups have told Reuters that they still want a better deal than the ACC proposal. They also say that if Argentina’s next offer is not up to scratch they will have a so-called “lock up”, which would prevent any of the individual firms in the groups peeling off and accepting a deal if the government did try the Pac-Man approach.

Chilufya, 47, was charged with four counts of possession of property suspected of being proceeds of crime, an Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) spokesman said after his arrest. “The court told us that the matter will be heard next week. We were not given any reasons for the adjournment,” Chilufya’s lawyer Tutwa Ngulube told Reuters. The hearing, scheduled for Thursday, is now set for July 16. Chilufya’s arrest is a test of the Zambian government’s willingness to keep a promise to fight corruption amidst accusations of graft from the opposition and increased scrutiny by holders of the country’s massive debt. If found guilty, Chilufya faces a maximum of 5 years in jail. The cabinet minister was released following his arrest and has continued serving as health minister. The case also highlights infighting within the ruling party ahead of next year’s elections. Chilufya is seen as a potential presidential candidate to replace President Edgar Lungu.

FILE PHOTO: A Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) staff uses a Lysol to clean a station at the lobby of Grand Central Station following the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in New York City, U.S., March 16, 2020. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon/File PhotoEarlier this week, Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc became the first company to win the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s approval to market two of its Lysol disinfectant sprays as household COVID-19 killers. Reuters previously reported that Reckitt had procured a strain of the virus from an independent lab, for testing. The EPA’s approval allows Reckitt to claim that Lysol can kill the novel coronavirus, or the SARS-CoV-2, on surfaces.  Ernesto Lippert, Lonza’s vice president of strategic development and advocacy, told Reuters Thursday that it, too, obtained a strain of SARS-CoV-2 and had tested a range of its formulations in approved EPA labs. He said data shows that the products could indeed kill SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces.   “We are probably be going to be the second one after Reckitt Benckiser to have a range of our products with the actual claim against SARS-CoV-2,” Lippert said, adding that Lonza is in the “last step” of the process and that “EPA’s approval is going to be very soon.”  Reuters could not independently verify Lonza’s discussions with the EPA or the timing on a possible decision by the agency. An EPA spokesperson said on Friday Lonza was one of several companies to have submitted laboratory data against SARS-CoV-2, but declined to elaborate on the approval timeline. Lonza is one of a few big chemical companies, along with U.S.-based Stepan Co and Pilot Chemicals, which own chemical formulations that go into many household products. The formulations typically have been pre-tested and EPA- approved for use against a variety of pathogens. Lonza’s current clients include 3M and the maker of Pine Glo kitchen and bathroom cleaner.   The EPA in March issued new guidelines, allowing hundreds of smaller companies to quickly gain regulatory approval without subjecting their products to time-consuming testing.   Applicants with data showing their products are effective against “non-enveloped” viruses won expedited approval to market their products as potentially effective against SARS-CoV-2. The EPA considers “non-enveloped” viruses to be harder-to-kill than even SARS-CoV-2, which is an “enveloped” virus.  That easing of the rules coupled with the licensing means companies can go through an accelerated EPA vetting process than the previous time frame of six months to one year for approval. Alexandra Dapolito Dunn, assistant administrator of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, said in a statement late March that the move would allow the EPA to better protect public health by assuring the availability of surface disinfectants to use against the novel coronavirus. “Supplemental registration is by far the easiest and quickest mechanism to get a product into the market,” said regulatory consultant Kevin Kutcel. “You just send a notification to the EPA and you can immediately get into the marketplace very, very quickly.”  Lonza’s Lippert said the company had a more than 110% spike in supplemental registrations of its formulations in the second quarter compared to the first quarter of the year. It also is currently reviewing 62 applications to license its formulas, most of which already are EPA-approved as effective against “non-enveloped” viruses.  “Normally regulators are pretty dogmatic about these things - they insist on all the testing and are pretty rigid,” said Michael Reynen, the former research head of Procter & Gamble’s surface care business in parts of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “But now the situation out there is pretty desperate.”  Consumer demand for cleaning and disinfecting products continues to soar.   “The Pope couldn’t have bought a bottle of Lysol last week if he wanted to, and now because of the EPA’s approval [of Lysol] it’ll be even harder,” said Josh Bloom, director of chemical and pharmaceutical sciences at consumer advocacy group American Council of Science and Health (ACSH).  Over the past five months, the EPA has approved nearly 750 products that license formulations as potentially effective against COVID, according to a list compiled by the American Chemistry Council trade group.   In late February, the list had only about 100 products, almost all from Lysol and Clorox. By June, the ACC list was comprised mostly of other brands licensing formulations from primary registrants Lonza, Pilot and Stepan, according to a Reuters analysis.   Stepan and Pilot were not immediately available to comment.

Over the last few months, our conference has prepared numerous scenarios related to the fall athletic season.” In a conference statement on Thursday, the ACC said it was delaying the start of the fall sports season until at least Sept. 1. The move applies to all exhibition and nonconference games in men’s and women’s cross country, field hockey, men’s and women’s soccer, and volleyball. The first football game involving ACC teams is scheduled for Sept. 2, when North Carolina State is set to visit Louisville.

FILE PHOTO: Argentina's economy minister, Martin Guzman, speaks at Congress on the country's economic situation and debt plan ahead of the meetings with the International Monetary Fund officials who are traveling to the country, in Buenos Aires, Argentina February 12, 2020. REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian/File Photo/File PhotoEconomy Minister Martin Guzman said the latest debt restructuring offer, the first from the three groups together, reflected a “lack of understanding” of the limitations faced by the crisis-stricken South American nation. “Accepting what some creditors ask for would mean subjecting Argentine society to more anguish,” Guzman said in a statement. “It would imply, for example, adjusting pensions, and we will not do it.” The two sides are trying to reach an agreement to restructure around $65 billion in foreign debt before a government-set deadline of Aug. 4, looking to avoid a messy and protracted legal standoff after recession-hit Argentina slipped into default in May. Argentina’s government made a “final” offer in July after talks broke down. Center-left President Alberto Fernandez and Guzman have since repeatedly said it was the maximum the country could offer. The three groups — the Ad Hoc group, Argentina Creditor Committee and Exchange Bondholder Group — said their proposal, issued earlier on Monday, made “significant economic and legal concessions.” They all agreed to oppose the government offer. “Our three groups have also signed a cooperation agreement reaffirming that Argentina’s current offer falls short of a proposal that can be supported by the creditor groups,” they said, adding they would not tender their bonds under the offer. The new creditor proposal puts the weighted average of the net present value (NPV) at 55.70 cents, according to a presentation seen by Reuters. Analysts had calculated the NPV of the government offer at 53-54 cents.    The unified opposition from the groups, which together hold more than a third of both Argentina’s “global” bonds and its “Exchange” bonds, will make it tough for the government to get a comprehensive deal on its current offer. The groups added, however, that a deal could still be struck. “We are confident that a consensual resolution is in sight and that such an agreement will provide a path towards a sustainable economic future for Argentina’s people,” they said. The three groups said their new proposal included an “amended version of the 2016 indenture” for eligible global bonds, a reference to the key legal clauses that have been a point of contention. Guzman reiterated the government’s offer was its “maximum effort” and he believed that most creditors would accept it. Hans Humes, CEO of Greylock Capital, which was one of the prominent voices in the ACC committee before it exited the group and tendered its bonds, said there was a risk that some were misreading the reality of the Argentine situation. “We may have been able to get concessions on legal language and adviser fees,” the distressed debt veteran said. “But not the net present value (NPV) that Argentina has said no to many times.” The country’s sovereign bonds, which have been buffeted since last year over concerns of a default, edged down 0.5% in  on Monday. They have risen over recent months on hopes of a deal. “We suspect we are getting closer to a deal,” analysts at Morgan Stanley said after seeing the groups combine and their new offer. “Having walked a long - and winding - road to get to where we are today, it would be surprising to see the parties becoming inflexible now.”  <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Argentina creditors counter proposal - tmsnrt.rs/2BiwLoV FILE PHOTO: The facade of Argentina's Central Bank is seen with scaffolding, during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbrake, in Buenos Aires, Argentina May 21, 2020.

Jun 22, 2018; Dallas, TX, USA; Dallas Mavericks first round pick Luka Doncic, guard Slovenia, (left) talks with head coach Rick Carlisle (right) during a press conference at the American Airlines Center. Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY SportsDoncic also must have a letter of clearance from FIBA, must pass a physical and then sign a contract, Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle told reporters earlier this week. Doncic was selected with the No. 3 overall pick in the 2018 NBA Draft in June by Atlanta, then traded to the Mavericks for guard Trae Young and a future first-round pick. Mavs owner Mark Cuban told reporters Friday that the team hopes Doncic will play in the team’s summer league game on Sunday, although the Slovenian star is not expected to see much time in Las Vegas. The Mavericks are reportedly concerned about overworking the 19-year-old, who led Real Madrid to the Liga ACB championship and EuroLeague title in the last few months. Counting all of his commitments to teams in Europe, Doncic has appeared in more than 150 games over the past two seasons. —Charlotte Hornets guard Malik Monk is expected to be sidelined for six to eight weeks because of a fractured right thumb, the team announced. He will miss the rest of Las Vegas Summer League action and be re-evaluated in late August or early September. The 20-year-old Monk, entering his second season after being picked in the first round (No. 11 overall) of the 2017 NBA Draft, was injured during the team’s summer league win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday in Las Vegas. Monk scored a team-high 23 points in the Hornets’ 88-87 loss, sinking four 3-pointers and 9 of 16 shots overall. The Hornets had reportedly been hoping to boost Monk’s confidence and improve his ball-handling over the summer league, as Monk recorded just one turnover in 27 minutes against the Thunder. —The Utah Jazz announced they have waived forward Jonas Jerebko, and he plans to join the Golden State Warriors if he clears waivers, according to an ESPN report. Jerebko’s $4.2 million salary for 2018-19 was not guaranteed, but any team can claim him on waivers, which would guarantee his salary. If he goes unclaimed, he will become a free agent on Monday, allowing him to sign a one-year deal for the veteran minimum with Golden State. Jerebko, 31, a 6-foot-10 forward, averaged 5.8 points and 3.3 rebounds in 15.3 minutes per game last season, appearing in 74 contests (19 starts) in his first season with the Jazz. He shot 41.4 percent from 3-point range, the second-best mark in a season during his nine-year career. —The Minnesota Timberwolves announced that they have signed rookie forward Keita Bates-Diop, who was the 48th pick in the 2018 NBA Draft. The team did not announce the terms of the contract, but The Athletic reported it was a three-year deal, with the first two years being fully guaranteed. Bates-Diop, from Ohio State, was named the 2017-18 Big Ten Player of the Year following his redshirt junior season with the Buckeyes. The Wooden Award finalist and Naismith Player of the Year award semifinalist averaged 19.8 points, 8.7 rebounds and 1.6 blocks on his way to being named a consensus Second Team All-American. He led the Big Ten in scoring, shooting 47.2 percent from the field and 35.9 percent from three-point range. —Philadelphia 76ers rookie guard Landry Shamet will miss the remainder of the NBA Summer League in Las Vegas after he sprained his right ankle Friday night against Boston, the 76ers medical staff announced.

The 76ers selected Shamet with the 26th pick of the 2018 NBA Draft in June after his two seasons at Wichita State. In 2017-18, he averaged 14.9 points and 5.2 assists per game and was named to the All-AAC First Team. —Field Level MediaOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

"January 13, 2020",ACB,"                Deadline to end use of Libor in doubt as banks stall on software changes - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsJanuary 13, 2020 /  1:02 PM / 6 months agoDeadline to end use of Libor in doubt as banks stall on software changesSinead Cruise, Lawrence White4 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - Many banks in Britain are unlikely to hit an October deadline to stop writing loans tied to the discredited Libor benchmark as they grapple with upgrading to crucial new software that allows them to use replacement reference rates, industry sources said. FILE PHOTO: A man walks past the city of London financial district as dawn breaks in London, Britain August 20, 2019. REUTERS/Hannah McKayIt is another sign of how practical considerations are undermining regulators’ desire for banks to move away from using the London Interbank Offered Rate, which is embedded in some $350 trillion of financial products worldwide. Once dubbed the world’s most important number, Libor was discredited after the 2008 financial crisis when authorities in the United States and Britain found traders had manipulated it to make a profit. While the October target is an industry-consensus goal rather than a regulatory edict, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) told Reuters it would take a dim view of lenders and borrowers ignoring the deadline. But the two rival firms that supply loan management software to the industry said not all banks will be ready, while only a handful of loans linked to alternative rates like Sonia (Sterling Overnight Index Average) have been issued so far. Fintech firm Finastra, which provides loan pricing and valuation software to more than 80 of the world’s biggest financial firms, launched an update to its LoanIQ software on Nov. 29 to incorporate Sonia-linked loan capabilities.   Only around 15 of Finastra’s 60 major financial clients likely to need the update have so far made the switch, Robert Downs, senior principal product manager at Finastra, told Reuters. He said an institution would usually need 6-18 months to upgrade and test the software given the number of internal systems a bank would have to plug into it. “It’s been convenient for banks to say they can’t progress because systems aren’t ready yet ... the Catch 22 was that the [software] vendors couldn’t get ready until the industry decided how it was going to move forward,” Downs said. Gregg Cerniglia, who leads Finastra rival FIS’s competing loan platform ACBS, said most but not all of its clients will be ready by the third-quarter deadline.  Both executives said small lenders in particular have been slower to upgrade their systems. Edwin Schooling Latter, director of markets and wholesale policy at the FCA said banks would need to clearly demonstrate how they plan to quickly upgrade their systems if they miss the deadline. “Firms who don’t have plans to end their dependency on Libor lending after that date will face a lot of questions from us as to how they are managing the risks,” he said. Industry sources said reasons for delays included strained resources at smaller banks already overwhelmed by major projects such as Brexit, and the preference of many borrowers to stick with the Libor rate.  Lenders are also wary that clients will be reluctant to use the new rates - which calculate interest by compounding the daily rate over the period of time matching the loan’s duration - as it will not be clear in advance what it will cost them.  “It’s a massive undertaking. No systems are up to scratch yet,” one senior banker said.

Malawi opposition parties are challenging the state electoral commission’s May 27 declaration of President Peter Mutharika as the victor despite complaints of irregularities including results sheets with sections blotted out or altered with correction fluid. The small, landlocked country has since been plagued by protests and demands for Mutharika to resign. On Dec. 8, the ACB received a complaint alleging that some people were attempting to bribe the five judges of the Constitutional Court. It arrested Thomson Mpinganjira on Wednesday in connection with the allegations, it said in a statement. “Dr Mpinganjira will be taken to court after the ACB has recorded a statement from him,” said ACB spokesperson Egrita Ndala. Mpinganjira spent the afternoon at the ACB offices in Blantyre. Hundreds of people gathered and chanted “Thief! Thief!” as he was being whisked away by tight security to a police station.  Mpinganjira, an accountant, is the former founding chief executive of the Malawi Stock Exchange (MSE). He left to open private First Discount House (FDH) which later evolved into a bank and has a nationwide branch network. He is also a board chairman of state-run power utility Escom.  Many people in Malawi have said he is connected to the ruling party, but he has always denied links. His lawyer Patrice Nkhono told Reuters by telephone that his client has no comment. The Constitution Court is expected to announce its ruling between Jan. 27 and Feb. 3, the High Court’s Registrar Agnes Patemba was quoted as saying by Zodiak Radio on Wednesday.

Doncic, 19, did not suit up for summer league but his work this week impressed Nowitzki, who knows a bit about entering the league as a young foreign star with high expectations. “He’s been here now for a week, scrimmaged every day, works hard and I really like what I see,” said Nowitzki, who was just six months older when he entered the NBA from Germany. “He’s really incredible with the ball for a big guy, and he’s a legit 6-8. “He’s unbelievable in the pick-and-roll. He does, like, over-the-head and between-the-leg passes to cutters,” said Nowitzki, who made his comments Tuesday in a radio interview on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas “The savviness he brings, the court vision — I couldn’t believe what I saw for a 19-, 20-year-old. Unbelievable. He’s a good shooter when he has time. I think he’s going to be great for us for a long, long time.” The Mavericks acquired Doncic — whom team owner Mark Cuban said was the top prospect on their board and “it wasn’t even close” — from the Atlanta Hawks for the rights to fifth overall pick Trae Young and a future first-round pick. Doncic, who signed his rookie deal in July, will make a bit more than $5.4 million in 2018-19. Last year’s third overall pick, Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum, signed a four-year, $30 million deal with club options in the third and fourth seasons. Nowitzki signed on for a 21st season this summer and will make $5 million in 2018-19. Doncic helped lead Real Madrid to the Liga ACB championship and EuroLeague title last season. The latter competition ended less than a week before the NBA draft on June 21. Between all of his commitments to teams in Europe, Doncic has appeared in more than 150 games over the past two seasons. Doncic will wear No. 77 for the Mavericks, a number he wore for the Slovenian national team. He wore No. 7 with Real Madrid. —Field Level MediaOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

"April 16, 2020",ACB,"                Asian lenders lag in Libor transition, virus adds to delays - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsApril 16, 2020 /  10:10 AM / 3 months agoAsian lenders lag in Libor transition, virus adds to delaysAlun John5 Min ReadHONG KONG (Reuters) - Few Asian banks will be able to make loans this year using new rates designed to replace Libor benchmarks, key software vendors say, leaving them facing a scramble ahead of Libor’s demise as the coronavirus pandemic further complicates transition plans. FILE PHOTO: A general view of surveillance cameras near the central business district in Singapore March 5, 2019. Picture taken March 5, 2019. REUTERS/Edgar SuGlobal regulators want to stick to the end-2021 date for scrapping the lending rate, despite calls from some in the industry to push back the deadline because of the impact of the pandemic on business activity.  If the banks have not moved all new and existing contracts to reference alternatives to Libor (the London Interbank Offered Rate) by 2022, then more than $300 trillion worth of bonds, derivative contracts and loans worldwide could be tied to a benchmark that no longer exists.  The uncertainty would be enormous and some borrowers may technically default on their loans.  Asia’s lenders trail rivals in London and New York, where regulators pushed the changeover aggressively, before the coronavirus pandemic reset the focus on other matters than lending benchmarks. “Banks in Asia are doing all their awareness and analysis this year and preparing to be able to offer the new rates next year,” said Gregg Cerniglia, who leads fintech FIS’ loan platform ACBS.  “Those in London and the U.S. want to be able to bring to market and service the new rates this year.”  Authorities demanded the financial industry move away from Libor after several banks were found to have manipulated Libor for profit, and fined around $9 billion. Shifting to new benchmarks requires consensus on standards, software upgrades by vendors, and changes in banks’ internal systems.  After Dec. 31, 2021, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates Libor, will not make banks submit estimates from which it is calculated, meaning Libor should cease to exist. Arnaud Picut, global head of the risk practice at fintech Finastra, which provides the Fusion LoanIQ software also said that their Asian clients were behind.  “Looking at the heat map of where we are busy, first came the U.S. and then London and the euro zone, now we are only starting to have meetings with Asian clients about the new software for pricing loans using the alternative rates,” he said.   COMPLEX TRANSITION Software is key to the transition. Libor’s estimates-based system means it is simple to gather bankers’ views on borrowing costs up to 12 months in the future.  The new rates are based on real, overnight transactions, requiring complex calculations to set longer-term versions.  Contracts for Libor-pegged loans which extend into 2022 must also be revised. The coronavirus pandemic pushed Libor transition planning down the list of priorities for UK banks, Reuters reported citing sources. In Asia too, the virus and its fallout has distracted bankers from other issues including Libor transition, said Andrew Ferguson, CEO of the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association (APLMA).   The situation in Asia is further complicated by the variety of domestic rates used alongside U.S. dollar Libor, and local officials’ different approaches. In Japan, there are 6,500 trillion yen ($60 trillion) worth of Libor-related contracts, but while yen Libor will also cease in 2021, officials have not favoured either of two alternative lending rates.  Singapore is moving to a new rate, the Singapore Overnight Rate Average, because its main benchmark relies on Libor   Hong Kong’s and Australia’s domestic benchmarks, Hibor and BBSW, are staying, but regulators warn their banks are still exposed to Libor. Hong Kong is also developing an alternative rate.  “Most Asian benchmarks have a robust calculation system and no history of manipulation. As they did not make many changes, you can see why we have been lagging,” said the APLMA’s Ferguson, “but anyone writing U.S. dollar loans needs to know exactly what’s going on.”  Some 56% of respondents to an APLMA survey earlier this year said they did not think the Asia Pacific syndicated loan market would be fully ready to use SOFR (the U.S. dollar Libor replacement) by 2021.  “The banks haven’t got much time left,” Ferguson said.

Shares in the bank closed down 6.72% at 48.55 rupees, after falling 12.4% on Monday, despite the bank stating late on Monday that “there would be no adverse financial implications” from the investigation. The bank confirmed late on Monday that its headquarters had been raided by the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, after some complaints of alleged malpractices and governance issues within the bank. Citing unnamed government sources, the Economic Times reported on Tuesday here that the ACB's investigations had uncovered the likely diversion of loans worth 10 billion rupees ($144 million), without giving more details. Jammu and Kashmir Bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the matter. In a surprise move, the bank on Saturday said that the state government had ousted Parvez Ahmed as its chairman and managing director and appointed R.K. Chhibber, a senior bank official, as interim chairman and managing director. In a statement to the stock exchange on Monday morning, the bank said its board at a meeting on Saturday had recommended splitting the roles of chairman and managing director to improve transparency. In a tweet, following his ouster, Ahmed said “Absolutely no regrets. Did my job most diligently, honestly and in the best interest of the institution. Open to scrutiny on each and every transaction I have done during my two decades of functioning in the bank.” India’s banks have come under increased scrutiny since state-run Punjab National Bank reported a massive $2 billion fraud last year, raising questions around the auditing and regulatory oversight of the country’s banks. $1 = 69.4259 Indian rupeesReporting by Swati Bhat; Editing by Susan FentonOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Jammu and Kashmir Bank did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the matter. Elsewhere, a government statement said India’s income tax department had initiated search and seizure operations on Tuesday at a Sringar-based business that had received a 1.7 billion rupee ($24.49 million) loan from Jammu and Kashmir Bank. The business, which deals in silk yarn, had later restructured the loan for a 770 million rupee “one time settlement”, of which it has paid only 503 million rupees, the statement said. The settlement of the loan was a result of an “active connivance” of a senior official of the Jammu and Kashmir, the statement added. The bank could not immediately be contacted for comment.

"May 2, 2019",ACEL,"                3M to buy medical device maker Acelity in $6.7 billion deal - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States DealsMay 2, 2019 /  10:51 AM / a year ago3M to buy medical device maker Acelity in $6.7 billion deal3 Min Read(Reuters) - 3M Co said on Thursday it would buy privately held medical device maker Acelity Inc in a deal valued at $6.7 billion, including debt, as the U.S. industrial conglomerate looks to expand its business in medical dressings and related products. FILE PHOTO:  The logo of Down Jones Industrial Average stock market index listed company 3M is shown in Irvine, California April 13, 2016.  REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo               The maker of Post-it notes and Scotch tape is buying the company and some of its units from a consortium of funds advised by Apax Partners, affiliates of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board. Acelity, under its KCI brand, makes advanced wound dressings and specialized systems that use a vacuum to seal off acute or chronic wounds, promoting faster healing.  The company reported revenue of $1.5 billion in 2018, nearly 80 percent of which came from sales of such specialized systems that provide “negative pressure wound therapy”. 3M said the acquisition would boost its presence in the advanced wound care market, which is valued at more than $8 billion and is growing at a rate of 4 percent to 6 percent annually. The purchase price values Acelity at 15 times its 2018 adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, 3M said. Acelity will become part of 3M’s medical solutions business that makes medical tapes, sterilization products and acute wound care dressings products. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2019. Excluding one-time expenses, 3M expects the deal to add 25 cents per share to its earnings in the first year following the closure of the deal. 3M also said it now expects full-year 2019 share buyback program to be in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion, compared with a prior range of $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion. The company’s stock was down about 1 percent at $184.23 before the bell. Credit Suisse was financial adviser to 3M, while Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP was its legal counsel. J.P.Morgan and Goldman Sachs were the consortium’s financial advisers, with Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and Jackson Walker LLP acting as its legal advisers.

The benchmark S&P 500 index snapped a three-day streak of closing at record highs on Wednesday after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stuck with the rate outlook and said the relapse in inflation rates was likely temporary. The Fed signaled little appetite to adjust rates any time soon, taking heart in continued job gains and economic growth and the likelihood that weak inflation will edge higher. Traders of U.S. short-term interest rate futures trimmed their bets that the central bank would cut rates before the end of the year. “Probably the market is not going to do much of anything and I say that because earnings are now winding down,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. “Investors are going to dwell on Powell’s comments. He said there is no need to cut rates anytime soon or indicated that next move might not be a rate cut.” Over halfway through earnings season, analysts now expect first-quarter earnings to rise 0.5% compared with a 2% fall estimated at the beginning of April, according to Refinitiv data. At 8:42 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 14 points, or 0.05%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 1 points, or 0.03% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 12 points, or 0.15%. Under Armour Inc gained 5.7% in premarket trading after the sportswear maker posted strong quarterly earnings and raised its full-year profit forecast, benefiting from stronger demand in overseas markets. Set to weigh on the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 3M Co, which dropped 0.7% after the industrial conglomerate said it would buy privately held medical device maker Acelity Inc in a deal valued at $6.7 billion. Dow Inc, the commodity chemicals division spun off from DowDuPont Inc, slipped 2% after reporting a 24 percent fall in core earnings. Hanesbrands rose 4.5% after the innerwear maker delivered first-quarter profit and sales ahead of analysts’ estimates. Shares of Abiomed Inc slumped 19.3% after the medical device maker reported quarterly revenue below expectations. Data at 10 a.m. ET will likely show factory goods orders to have increased 1.5% in March after a fall of 0.5% in the month before. Some hope emerged on the trade front after reports that the United States and China may be nearing a deal that would roll back some of the U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods.

"July 13, 2020",ACH,"                LHP Sandoval rejoins Angels after bout with coronavirus - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Sports NewsJuly 13, 2020 /  10:59 PM / 8 days agoLHP Sandoval rejoins Angels after bout with coronavirus2 Min ReadLos Angeles Angels left-hander Patrick Sandoval revealed Monday the reason why he made a delayed return to the team’s training camp: He was waiting to be cleared team after testing positive for coronavirus last month. Sandoval received his positive diagnosis June 22, and he didn’t join his teammates until Thursday, after he had two negative coronavirus tests last week in a span of 24 hours. The Angels had reassembled in early July ahead of the abbreviated season that will open July 23. The 23-year old, who hails from nearby Mission Viejo, Calif., told reporters he believes he might have contracted coronavirus while playing a round of golf with a friend. “Honestly, the first three days were a little rough. I had body aches, chills, a fever,” Sandoval said on a video conference call from the team’s alternate training site in Long Beach, Calif. “My back just had a bunch of pressure on it. It was unlike anything I’d ever felt before. It was pretty heavy for a few days. ... “I try to be as safe as possible, I limit contact with friends and family, but I still ended up getting it. No one really knows what’s going on with the virus. There are so many questions to be answered about it. One day you’re in contact with somebody and you get it. It kind of opened my eyes to that.” Because he did not throw for two weeks, his odds of starting the season with the major league team are slim, according to manager Joe Maddon. Sandoval made his major league debut last season, going 0-4 with a 5.03 ERA over 10 appearances (nine starts). He struck out 42 batters and walked 19 in 39 1/3 innings.

"July 14, 2020",ACH,"                Moderna Phase 1 results show coronavirus vaccine safe, induces immune response - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Health NewsJuly 14, 2020 /  9:03 PM / 6 days agoModerna Phase 1 results show coronavirus vaccine safe, induces immune responseJulie Steenhuysen5 Min ReadCHICAGO (Reuters) - Moderna Inc’s (MRNA.O) experimental vaccine for COVID-19 showed it was safe and provoked immune responses in all 45 healthy volunteers in an ongoing early-stage study, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday.  Volunteers who got two doses of the vaccine had high levels of virus-killing antibodies that exceeded the average levels seen in people who had recovered from COVID-19, the team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.  No study volunteers experienced a serious side effect, but more than half reported mild or moderate reactions such as fatigue, headache, chills, muscle aches or pain at the injection site. These were more likely to occur after the second dose and in people who got the highest dose. Experts say a vaccine is needed to put an end to the coronavirus pandemic that has sickened millions and caused nearly 575,000 deaths worldwide.  Moderna was the first to start human testing of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus on March 16, 66 days after the genetic sequence of the virus was released. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, whose researchers developed Moderna’s vaccine candidate, called the results “good news,”  noting that the study found no serious adverse events and the vaccine produced “reasonably high” levels of virus-killing or neutralizing antibodies.  “If your vaccine can induce a response comparable with natural infection, that’s a winner,” Fauci said in a telephone interview. “That’s why we’re very pleased by the results.” Moderna shares jumped more than 15% in after-hours trading on Tuesday. The U.S. government is supporting Moderna’s vaccine with nearly half a billion dollars and has chosen it as one of the first to enter large-scale human trials. A successful vaccine could be a turning point for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna, which has never had a licensed product. Related CoverageModerna CEO expects governments to allocate early COVID-19 vaccinesModerna’s shot, mRNA-1273, uses ribonucleic acid (RNA) - a chemical messenger that contains instructions for making proteins. When injected into people, the vaccine instructs cells to make proteins that mimic the outer surface of the coronavirus, which the body recognizes as a foreign invader, and mounts an immune response against. The results released Tuesday involved three doses of the vaccine, tested in groups of 15 volunteers aged 18-55 who got two shots, 28 days apart. The groups tested 25, 100 or 250 micrograms of the vaccine. Adverse events after the second dose occurred in seven of the 13 volunteers who got the 25-microgram dose, all 15 participants who received the 100 microgram dose and all 14 who got the 250 microgram dose. In the highest-dose group, three patients had severe reactions such as fever, chills, headache or nausea. One of these had a fever of 103.28 Fahrenheit (39.6 C).   “We didn’t see any events that are characterized as serious adverse events,” said lead author Dr Lisa Jackson of Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle, referring to reactions that require hospitalization or result in death.  In June, Moderna said it selected the 100-microgram dose for its late-stage study to minimize adverse reactions.  At that dose, Moderna said the company is on track to deliver about 500 million doses per year, and possibly up to 1 billion doses per year, starting in 2021, from the company’s internal U.S. manufacturing site and strategic collaboration with Swiss drugmaker Lonza (LONN.S). “It’s a good first step,” said Dr William Schaffner, a vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who was not involved in the study. “There’s nothing here that would inhibit one from going ahead to the Phase 2/Phase 3 trials,” he said. In April, Moderna expanded the Phase 1 trial to include adults over 55, who are more at risk of serious disease, with the aim of enrolling 120 volunteers. Moderna said it will follow study volunteers for a year to look for side effects and check how long immunity lasts.

REUTERS/Brian SnyderModerna started its phase 2 trial in May and expects to start a phase 3 trial on July 27.  Phase 1 trials aim to ensure a treatment is safe and help determine an effective dose. Phase 2 trials test a treatment in a larger group and get an early read on effectiveness. Phase 3 trials are conducted in a large group of individuals to confirm efficacy and identify rare side effects. Moderna’s Phase 3 trial will be conducted in 30,000 volunteers.

FILE PHOTO: A sign marks the headquarters of Moderna Inc, which is developing a vaccine against the coronavirus, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S., May 18, 2020.   REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File PhotoWall Street analysts said data from 45 healthy trial volunteers suggested the vaccine could protect against infection by the virus, and generate blockbuster sales if it proves to work in larger trials.  “We have already started to make material at risk in preparation for commercial (vaccine) doses. We are moving as quickly and as safely as possible,” Moderna Chief Executive Stéphane Bancel said on a conference call to discuss the tudy. Moderna said it is on track to be able to deliver around 500 million doses or more per year in 2021. The early-stage trial data, however, is not a definite conclusion that the shot could work in humans.  “When you’re giving a vaccine to otherwise healthy people, safety is paramount. So the most important takeaway is that the 100-microgram dose, which is going into phase 3 trial, was safe,” said Piper Sandler analyst Edward Tenthoff, who estimated the vaccine could generate revenues of $12.5 billion to $25 billion. No serious side effects were reported in the ongoing study, but more than half of the volunteers reported mild or moderate reactions such as fatigue, headache, chills, muscle aches or pain at the injection site. Moderna was among the first drugmakers to start testing a coronavirus vaccine in humans, and is due to start late-stage trials later this month.  Moderna’s shares were up 10.8% at $83.17 in morning trading on the Nasdaq after hitting an all-time high of $88.37 earlier in the day.  The vaccine, mRNA-1273, uses a technology that has not yet yielded an approved product. Other drugmakers such as AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) and BioNTech 2UAy.F are also racing to get a viable and safe vaccine on the market.

But the recent spike in the case count - which now includes Socialist Party Vice President Diosdado Cabello and Oil Minister Tareck El Aissami - signals that Venezuela’s precarious health system will be tested by the pandemic.  The country’s hospitals already suffer from constant blackouts, lack of running water, and chronic shortages of basic supplies, according to human rights groups and health workers.  Irene Guedes, 54, a housewife in the impoverished Bermudez 1 neighborhood in southwest Caracas, said she was in contact with a couple who tested positive for the novel coronaries last week.  On Tuesday, she received a visit from a government public health brigade that knocked on doors in the area to find out who had symptoms for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. “I feel dizzy ... I can’t smell anything,” said Guedes, wearing a white cloth face mask and a black sweater with a hood that covered her head.  Losing one’s sense of smell and taste are known symptoms of the disease. Dr. Wilfredo Sanchez, part of the 15-member health brigade, recommended she get tested at a nearby health center. Guedes’ neighbor Analeida Games, 61, said she and her husband Orlando Perdomo, 57, suffered fever and aching bones - but that neither had gotten tested. “That was just a flu,” Games told another member of the brigade. The government has done nothing to address these problems since declaring a strict quarantine in early March, said Jose Manuel Olivares, a doctor and legislator who is also part of Guaido’s health advisory team. “The government ... did not buy ventilators. It did not improve the hospitals. It did not repair x-ray (machines). It did not do what needed to be done,” he said in a telephone interview. Venezuela’s roughly 300 public hospitals have 23,000 beds ready to receive patients, according to official figures. Health worker groups say 12 doctors and two nurses have died from COVID-19, and a lack of protective equipment was raising infection risks for other medical personnel. The information ministry did not reply to a request for comment. Maduro on Tuesday defended the country’s response to the pandemic, and said foreign news agencies including Reuters were focusing on negative incidents while ignoring positive developments. “In Venezuela, everyone (with coronaries) goes to the hospital - everyone,” Maduro said during an evening broadcast. “Every is attended to, nobody is wandering around in the streets or abandoned in their homes.” Medical experts have warned about weak hospital infrastructure, and say coronaries testing is limited because the government has only authorized a single laboratory to carry out tests. Slideshow (4 Images)Maduro attributes the increased infection rate to the return of Venezuelan migrants from neighboring countries, saying it was a sign that Colombia and Brazil have mismanaged the pandemic. Maduro and members of his cabinet have talked about the “Colombian virus” and claimed it is a more aggressive strain, without citing supporting medical evidence. They have claimed that this, in part, explains the situation in the border state of Zulia, which has emerged as a hot spot for the disease. [L1N2DZ1FM] Some doctors in Guaido’s medical advisory team dispute the idea of a Colombia strain of the virus, and say the Zulia outbreak has been driven largely by a breakdown of basic services such as power and water.

"July 14, 2020",ACH,"                Moderna Phase 1 results show coronavirus vaccine safe, induces immune response - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Company NewsJuly 14, 2020 /  9:00 PM / 7 days agoModerna Phase 1 results show coronavirus vaccine safe, induces immune responseJulie Steenhuysen4 Min ReadCHICAGO, July 14 (Reuters) - Moderna Inc’s experimental vaccine for COVID-19 showed it was safe and provoked immune responses in all 45 healthy volunteers in an ongoing early-stage study, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday. No study volunteers experienced a serious side effect, but more than half reported mild or moderate reactions such as fatigue, headache, chills, muscle aches or pain at the injection site. These were more likely to occur after the second dose and in people who got the highest dose, the team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. Moderna was the first to start human testing of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus on March 16, some 66 days after the genetic sequence of the virus was released. Experts say a vaccine is needed to put an end to the pandemic that has sickened millions and caused nearly 575,000 deaths worldwide. “The world urgently needs vaccines to protect against COVID-19,” said Dr Lisa Jackson of Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle and lead author of the study. The federal government is supporting Moderna’s vaccine with nearly half a billion dollars and has chosen it as one of the first to enter large-scale human trials. A successful vaccine could be a turning point for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna, which has never had a licensed product. Moderna’s shot, mRNA-1273, uses ribonucleic acid (RNA) - a chemical messenger that contains instructions for making proteins. When injected into people, the vaccine instructs cells to make proteins that mimic the outer surface of the coronavirus, which the body recognizes as a foreign invader, and mounts an immune response against. The results released on Tuesday involved three doses of the vaccine, tested in groups of 15 volunteers aged 18-55 who got two shots, 28 days apart. The groups tested 25, 100 or 250 micrograms of the vaccine. The team reported that individuals who got two doses of the vaccine had high levels of virus-killing neutralizing antibodies that exceeded the average levels seen in people who had recovered from COVID-19. Adverse events after the second dose occurred in seven of the 13 volunteers who got the 25-microgram dose, all 15 participants who received the 100 microgram dose and all 14 who got the 250 microgram dose. In the highest-dose group, three patients had severe reactions such as fever, chills, headache or nausea. One of these had a fever of 103.28 Fahrenheit (39.6 C). “We didn’t see any events that are characterized as serious adverse events,” Jackson said, referring to reactions that require hospitalization or result in death. In June, Moderna said it selected the 100-microgram dose for its late-stage study to minimize adverse reactions. At that dose, Moderna said the company is on track to deliver about 500 million doses per year, and possibly up to 1 billion doses per year, starting in 2021, from the company’s internal U.S. manufacturing site and strategic collaboration with Swiss drugmaker Lonza. “It’s a good first step,” said Dr William Schaffner, a vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who was not involved in the study. “There’s nothing here that would inhibit one from going ahead to the Phase 2/Phase 3 trials,” he said. “A little fatigue and headache and myalgia (muscle pain) and pain at the injection site is a small price to pay for protection against COVID-19.” In April, Moderna expanded the Phase 1 trial to include adults over 55, who are more at risk of serious disease, with the aim of enrolling 120 volunteers. Moderna said it will follow study volunteers for a year after the second shot, to look for side effects and check how long immunity lasts.

Wall Street analysts said data from 45 healthy trial volunteers suggested the vaccine could protect against the virus infection, and generate blockbuster sales if it proves to work in larger trials. The early-stage trial data, however, is not a definite conclusion the shot could work in humans. “Assuming a price of $50-100 per vaccine could equate to revenues of $12.5 billion to $25 billion,” said Piper Sandler analyst Edward Tenthoff. No serious side effects were reported in the ongoing study, but more than half of the volunteers reported mild or moderate reactions such as fatigue, headache, chills, muscle aches or pain at the injection site. “It is difficult to know how this will ultimately translate to clinical outcomes, but we find these results to be encouraging on the surface,” said J.P. Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov. Moderna was among the first drugmakers to start testing a coronavirus vaccine in humans, and is due to start late-stage trials later this month. Data from potential vaccine candidates has swayed the broader market and U.S. stock futures were higher on Wednesday. Moderna’s shares were up 17.3% at $88 before the opening bell. It expects to deliver about 500 million doses a year, and possibly, up to $1 billion doses per year starting in 2021. The vaccine, mRNA-1273, uses a technology that has not yet yielded an approved product till date. Other drugmakers such as AstraZeneca Plc and BioNTech are also racing to get a viable and safe vaccine on the market.

FILE PHOTO: A man walks inside the flooded Cochin international airport after the opening of Idamalayar, Cheruthoni and Mullaperiyar dam shutters following heavy rain, on the outskirts of Kochi, India, August 15, 2018. REUTERS/Sivaram V/File PhotoMajor airports in storm-vulnerable regions such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and India have been effectively turned into giant parking lots as COVID-19 travel restrictions choke demand. “If you have got those aircraft on the ground, you can imagine to get them back up and running in a short space of time is no easy thing,” said Gary Moran, head of Asia aviation at insurance broker Aon. “The challenge is you can have a typhoon or hurricane coming and there are going to be a lot of aircraft that aren’t going to be able to be moved in time.” Airline insurers, already on the hook to refund large portions of crash risk premiums because of the groundings, now face the larger-than-usual risk posed by having lots of airplanes grouped together at airports, industry experts said. “One event could create damage which costs millions to repair, maybe even closer to hundreds of millions depending on the aircraft that are involved,” said James Jordan, a senior associate at law firm HFW’s Asia aerospace and insurance practices. In guidance to be issued to airport operators this week, seen by Reuters, the trade group Airports Council International (ACI) warns that flying the planes out of danger, the practice in normal times, may not be possible. It says extra precautions such as more tie-downs could be needed. “Extreme weather events such as hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones are a seasonal hazard in many areas of the world, and in the COVID context provide an additional layer of hazard with many airports accommodating larger numbers of parked aircraft,” ACI Director General Angela Gittens said in a statement to Reuters. Manila’s Ninoy Aquino International Airport has so many aircraft on the ground that is using a runway for parking, according to a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines.  Taiwan’s aviation regulator said it had asked airports to hold typhoon preparation meetings 36 hours in advance this year, rather than the usual 24 hours, to give airlines enough time to make parking requests. It will open up taxiways if needed at Taipei’s main international airport, Taoyuan, to allow for 160 parked planes. EVA Airways Corp said its plans included securing aircraft, parking them in hangars and sending some to other airports in Taiwan and abroad. Taiwan’s largest carrier, China Airlines Ltd, said it had typhoon plans but declined to provide details. Hong Kong International Airport, home to Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and Hong Kong Airlines, said it had 150 planes parked and precautionary measures had already been carried out for most as part of typhoon season preparations.  The measures include fuelling up the planes to make them heavier, tying weights to nose gear, adding weight in the cargo hold, putting double chocks on aircraft wheels and flying planes to other airports, the airport operator said. Osaka’s Kansai International Airport, whose runway flooded when Typhoon Jebi breached a seawall in 2018, said it had raised the wall’s height and waterproofed facilities. Airports will also need to ensure they do not have any loose equipment that poses a risk to airplanes or they could face claims from airline insurers, Aon’s Moran said. “The airport is supposed to maintain a safe environment for the aircraft,” he said. “That is their duty of care.”  Reporting by Jamie Freed and Ben Blanchard; additional reporting by Yimou Lee in Taipei, Tim Kelly in Tokyo and Neil Jerome Morales in Manila.

A migrant looks on while shielding from the rain along with fellow migrants from Africa, Cuba and Haiti, who are stranded in Honduras after borders were closed due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, during their trek northward in an attempt to reach the U.S., in Tegucigalpa, Honduras June 3, 2020.

On Tuesday, the group of departed the department of Choluteca, near the border with Nicaragua.  “We’re already on the way, we want to reach the border with Guatemala and then, at least for now, get to Mexico until the situation in the United States improves,” Cuban migrant Armando Hernandez, said in a telephone interview. “I do not agree to return. I left my country because they were threatening me and my family,” Hernandez said. The United Nations and a local government organization for children, youths and family welfare provided transportation, the Honduran government said in a statement. According to civil society group ACI-PARTICIPA, the caravan was made up of 101 mostly Africans and Haitians, but also 12 Cubans and five Peruvians. Honduran migration authorities put the number of people at 70.  About 260 people have been stranded in Honduras since mid-March when countries in the region closed borders. Carolina Menjivar, director of the National Institute of Migration of Honduras, told reporters the group has rejected a government proposal to help the migrants return to their countries of origin.  “They have no other alternative than a voluntary assisted return to their countries,” he explained.

FILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - Hungarian Grand Prix - Hungaroring, Budapest, Hungary - August 4, 2019   McLaren's Lando Norris in action during the race   REUTERS/Lisi NiesnerOrganisers of the Hungarian, Italian and Belgian Grands Prix, which stand to lose out on tickets sales, revealed new deals.  Formula One, whose season has yet to start due to the COVID-19 pandemic, announced an eight-round schedule on Tuesday with the season starting in Austria on July 5. Austria’s Red Bull Ring and Britain’s Silverstone will both have two races each with Hungary, Spain, Belgium and Italy hosting the remainder. “We did our best during the discussions to get a good agreement both for the country and the sport even in these challenging times,” Hungararing CEO Zsolt Gyulay told the http://www.hungaroring.hu website. “We cannot say exact numbers, but (the) rights fee is a fragment of the one we pay in case of an open event. Furthermore, we have achieved an extension in our contract, so now it is valid until 2027 instead of 2026.” Hungary is set to be the third race of a shortened season on July 19, after Austria’s two. Gyulay said the annual increase of the rights fee had also been reduced. The Hungarian Grand Prix has been held every year since  1986 and, with the Monaco showcase cancelled for 2020, will boast the second longest uninterrupted run after Monza. Vanessa Maes, CEO of Belgium’s Spa-Francorchamps race, said this year’s event would be organised outside of the regular promoter contract, which had been extended to 2022. “This new model will allow the Spa-Francorchamps Circuit... to somewhat mitigate the financial effects of this historic crisis,” she told the http://www.spa-francorchamps.be website. The Italian Automobile Club (ACI) said Monza’s contract had been extended to 2025. “We’re not in the business of financially supporting a promoter who’s in trouble, but we are in the business of having good partnerships for the long term,” Formula One’s managing director for motorsport Ross Brawn told racefans.net. “In some cases some circuits have extended their contract by a year because they’ve lost this year. That gives them that stability. “We’ve been fairly realistic I think in the approach we’re taking.

REUTERS/Fred Prouser(Reuters) - U.S. grocery retailer Albertsons Cos Inc said on Thursday its initial public offering would target to raise up to $1.32 billion. The company said certain selling stockholders are offering 65.8 million shares at an indicative price range of $18 to $20 per share. The grocery retailer will not receive any proceeds from the IPO.  The upper end of the range would value the company at $11.61 billion, based on outstanding shares including certain convertible preferred stocks. The IPO’s underwriters have an option of buying an additional 9.9 million shares. Including this, the offering could fetch as much as $1.51 billion. Albertsons, which operates namesake stores as well as U.S. supermarket chain Safeway and grocer Von, filed paperwork for an IPO in March, years after poor market conditions derailed its earlier attempt at going public. Grocers, including Albertsons’ 20 well-known banners, have benefited from panic buying and stockpiling amid the COVID-19 pandemic, as consumers rushed to supermarkets days before long lockdowns. Albertsons is backed by Cerberus Capital Management LP, a buyout firm controlled by billionaire Stephen Feinberg. The listing would pave the road for Cerberus to exit the company. Albertsons said on Thursday it would list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “ACI”. BofA Securities, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and Citigroup are the lead underwriters for the offering.

REUTERS/Fred Prouser/File Photo(Reuters) - U.S. supermarket operator Albertsons Companies Inc ACI.N decided to go ahead with a downsized $800 million initial public offering (IPO) on Thursday, the culmination of multiple attempts by its private equity owner Cerberus Capital Management LP to cash out. Cerberus has been an investor in Albertsons since 2006 and has been trying to take the company public since 2015. The grocer’s anemic growth had faced pushback from IPO investors, as well as shareholders of Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N), the pharmacy chain it tried to merge with two years ago. The COVID-19 pandemic buoyed Albertsons’ fortunes, however, as consumers stocked up on food while staying at home. Albertsons’ sales in March and most of April were up 34% from last year. Yet the scaling back of the IPO on Thursday indicates that some investor skepticism lingers. Below-target pricing may also signal recent robust investor demand for new listings is softening after U.S. stocks fell sharply on Wednesday amid a surge in coronavirus cases in the United States. Wall Street’s main indexes closed higher in choppy trading on Thursday. Rival supermarket chain Kroger Co (KR.N) said last week that the surge in demand for essential goods it saw during the coronavirus outbreak was fading, as American households reconsider their needs.  Albertsons said it sold shares in its IPO at $16 apiece, below its $18-$20 target range. This values the company at around $9.3 billion, excluding its $8.5 billion debt pile as of the end of February. The Boise, Idaho-based company also cut the number of shares sold in the IPO to 50 million from 65.8 million. The downsizing of the IPO came after heated discussions between the underwriters and Cerberus, which deliberated whether to walk away from the offering at the last minute, as it did in 2015, a source familiar with the deliberations said. Following the IPO, Cerberus will own around 31.9% of Albertsons, which operates namesake stores as well as U.S. supermarket chain Safeway and grocers Vons and Acme. Last month, buyout firm Apollo Global Management Inc (APO.N) acquired $1.75 billion of convertible preferred shares in Albertsons, representing a 17.5% stake in the company.     Albertsons’ shares are due to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday under the symbol “ACI.” BofA Securities, Goldman Sachs & Co, JPMorgan and Citigroup are the lead underwriters on the IPO.

"June 3, 2020",ACI,"                UPDATE 1-As Asia's tropical storm season arrives, grounded airplanes at risk of damage - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States FinancialsJune 3, 2020 /  5:38 AM / 2 months agoUPDATE 1-As Asia's tropical storm season arrives, grounded airplanes at risk of damageJamie Freed, Ben Blanchard5 Min Read* Hundreds of airplanes grounded at vulnerable airports * Insurers concerned about potential for damage * Flying planes away as usual may not be possible (Adds details of Mumbai cyclone preparations) By Jamie Freed and Ben Blanchard SYDNEY/TAIPEI June 3 (Reuters) - Airlines, airports and insurers across Asia are bracing for the prospect of unusually high damage as the region’s tropical storm season begins, as hundreds of aircraft grounded by the coronavirus pandemic can’t be moved easily. Major airports in storm-vulnerable regions such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and India have been effectively turned into giant parking lots as COVID-19 travel restrictions choke demand. “If you have got those aircraft on the ground, you can imagine to get them back up and running in a short space of time is no easy thing,” said Gary Moran, head of Asia aviation at insurance broker Aon. “The challenge is you can have a typhoon or hurricane coming and there are going to be a lot of aircraft that aren’t going to be able to be moved in time.” Airline insurers, already on the hook to refund large portions of crash risk premiums because of the groundings, now face the larger-than-usual risk posed by having lots of airplanes grouped together at airports, industry experts said. “One event could create damage which costs millions to repair, maybe even closer to hundreds of millions depending on the aircraft that are involved,” said James Jordan, a senior associate at law firm HFW’s Asia aerospace and insurance practices. In guidance to be issued to airport operators this week, seen by Reuters, the trade group Airports Council International (ACI) warns that flying the planes out of danger, the practice in normal times, may not be possible. It says extra precautions such as more tie-downs could be needed. “Extreme weather events such as hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones are a seasonal hazard in many areas of the world, and in the COVID context provide an additional layer of hazard with many airports accommodating larger numbers of parked aircraft,” ACI Director General Angela Gittens said in a statement to Reuters. Mumbai’s airport said on Wednesday that small private planes vulnerable to strong winds had top priority to be flown out or parked in a hangar as the city braced for a rare cyclone. Manila’s Ninoy Aquino International Airport has so many aircraft on the ground that is using a runway for parking, according to a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines. Taiwan’s aviation regulator said it had asked airports to hold typhoon preparation meetings 36 hours in advance this year, rather than the usual 24 hours, to give airlines enough time to make parking requests. It will open up taxiways if needed at Taipei’s main international airport, Taoyuan, to allow for 160 parked planes. EVA Airways Corp said its plans included securing aircraft, parking them in hangars and sending some to other airports in Taiwan and abroad. Taiwan’s largest carrier, China Airlines Ltd, said it had typhoon plans but declined to provide details. Hong Kong International Airport, home to Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and Hong Kong Airlines, said it had 150 planes parked and precautionary measures had already been carried out for most as part of typhoon season preparations. The measures include fuelling up the planes to make them heavier, tying weights to nose gear, adding weight in the cargo hold, putting double chocks on aircraft wheels and flying planes to other airports, the airport operator said. Osaka’s Kansai International Airport, whose runway flooded when Typhoon Jebi breached a seawall in 2018, said it had raised the wall’s height and waterproofed facilities. Airports will also need to ensure they do not have any loose equipment that poses a risk to airplanes or they could face claims from airline insurers, Aon’s Moran said. “The airport is supposed to maintain a safe environment for the aircraft,” he said. “That is their duty of care.” (Reporting by Jamie Freed and Ben Blanchard; additional reporting by Yimou Lee in Taipei, Tim Kelly in Tokyo, Neil Jerome Morales in Manila and Rajendra Jadhav in Mumbai.

REUTERS/Fred Prouser/File Photo/File Photo(Reuters) - Buyout firm Apollo Global Management (APO.N) said on Wednesday it has invested $1.75 billion in Albertsons Companies Inc, a sign of confidence in the debt-laden U.S. supermarket operator whose fortunes have picked up in the coronavirus outbreak. The parent of grocery chains such as Safeway, Vons and Acme for years struggled to generate enough earnings growth to pursue an initial public offering (IPO) that would allow its owners, including private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, to cash out. But the pandemic has fueled a boom in its business as consumers who stay at home buy more groceries. Albertsons said last month that its sales in March and most of April were up 34% from last year.   The deal with Apollo values Albertsons at around $10 billion, excluding its $8.7 billion debt pile as of the end of February. It gives Albertsons more time and a valuation floor in its pursuit of an IPO, for which it has registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Apollo said it and a group of other investors acquired $1.75 billion of convertible preferred shares in Albertsons, representing a 17.5% stake in the company.  “We believe the investment led by the Apollo funds represents a vote of confidence in both our business and our long-term strategy,” Albertsons Chief Executive Vivek Sankaran said in a statement.  Other supermarket operators, such as Walmart Inc (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N), Kroger Co (KR.N) and Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), have also seen a spike in sales as consumers stockpile essentials. Albertsons has said it has hired more than 55,000 associates since the beginning of March to cope with demand, and the Boise, Idaho-based company temporarily increased pay for all front-line staff by $2 per hour. It also said it has seen a big jump in online grocery orders for home delivery.

FILE PHOTO: The North West Shelf Gas Project is pictured at sunset in Burrup at the Pilbarra region in Western Australia April 19, 2011.  REUTERS/Daniel Munoz/File PhotoThe move marks a long-awaited shake-up of ownership in the 30-year-old project as it runs out of gas and shifts towards becoming a facility that will process gas into LNG for third parties. “Chevron Australia has made the decision to market its non-operated one-sixth interest in the North West Shelf (NWS) project, following a number of unsolicited approaches from a range of credible buyers,” the company said in an emailed statement. It gave no further details. The project partners have invested more than A$34 billion  ($23 billion) over the life of the project, however the gas fields that feed the NWS LNG plant are expected to start running out in the next few years. The plant owners are looking to line up supply from new fields, and plan to charge a fee to process that gas from third parties. Chevron’s stake could fetch $3 billion to $4 billion, said one analyst, who declined to be named. The sale is not a must, as the U.S. giant has said it is on track to meet its $5 billion to $10 billion target for asset sales between 2018 and 2020. Chevron said it remains committed to its Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects, also in Western Australia. Analysts said it made sense for Chevron to sell its NWS LNG stake now, after it failed to seal a deal to supply gas to the plant from its undeveloped Clio and Acme fields. Likely suitors include infrastructure investors as well as NWS LNG operator and co-owner Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AX), analysts said. “(Woodside) is well-positioned financially and has announced it is ready and looking for M&A opportunities in Australia,” said David Low, an analyst at consultants Wood Mackenzie. Woodside declined to comment. The other owners of the project are BHP Group (BHP.AX) (BHPB.L), BP Plc (BP.L), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and a joint venture between Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T) and Mitsui & Co (8031.T).

FILE PHOTO: Argentine one hundred peso bills are displayed in this picture illustration taken September 3, 2019. REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian/Illustration/File PhotoThe South American grains producer, which is renegotiating $65 billion debt and has been locked out of capital markets after a default in May, had shrunk the deficit last year with tough monetary tightening to trim back a heavy debt load. That tightening has now gone by the wayside to firefight the impact of COVID-19, with money taps opened to counteract a tanking economy pushing millions into poverty. Argentina posted a fiscal deficit in May of around $3.7 billion, the deepest on record. The deficit could swell to 5.5%-6.5% of gross domestic product for the full year, analysts polled by Reuters said, from around 2.2%-2.5% so far this year. “The pandemic and quarantine have hammered the fiscal accounts, which were already in a fragile situation before the coronavirus outbreak,” said Isaias Marini, economist at consulting firm Econviews. “Primary spending soared in the last three months, while income plummeted in line with a downturn in economic activity.” The left-leaning government of President Albert Fernandez has rolled out assistance packages to low-income workers and families while freezing utilities tariffs to help people hit by the lockdown. Primary spending almost doubled in May to 579.5 billion pesos ($8.23 billion). Despite 45% annual inflation, tax receipts have stalled during the lockdown, which has been extended and tightened in the densely-populated area in and around capital city Buenos Aires. “The fiscal deficit increased and now we are in a situation that is way more delicate than the situation before COVID-19,” Economy Minister Martin Guzman said during an event in June. The economy has tanked during the pandemic. Economic activity in April plummeted 26.4% and the International Monetary Fund has forecast a nearly 10% economic contraction for the full year. It would be Argentina’s third straight year in recession. FISCAL GAINS “ERODED” The country, under the former administration of Mauricio Macri, had slowly improved its fiscal position with tight policies to rein in spending, in part to meet targets agreed with creditors like the IMF. Morgan Stanley said that with high spending to battle the virus “fiscal consolidation efforts of the past couple of years are being quickly eroded” even as Argentina races to restructure $65 billion in foreign debt. “Amid lack of market access, Argentina should incur in further deficit monetization to fund the widening fiscal gap, in turn helping fuel inflation once domestic demand conditions begin to normalize,” the investment bank said in a note. Local consultancy ACM, which predicts a fiscal deficit exceeding 6% for the year, said the outlook would worsen with tumbling tax revenue and “higher costs to help firms and workers in quarantine mitigate the spread of the coronavirus”. Analysts said that even after Argentina strikes a debt deal and the pandemic ends, the country will still need to climb an economic mountain, including tempering runaway prices once demand rebounds given recent injections of cash. Month-on-month inflation has come down recently as the lockdown has hit consumer spending. “The main thing now is to renegotiate the debt, so you can go back into debt to finance the expansionary fiscal policy,” said Natalia Motyl, an economist at policy think tank Libertad y Progreso, adding the government eventually may have to raise tax revenue and cut pension payments. “Argentina during this crisis does not have much room to maneuver. But come what way, once this crisis is over, there needs to be a comprehensive economic plan.” (Graphic: Virus strains Argentina's state purse, here) Reporting by Hernan Nessi; Additional reporting by Walter Bianchi and Jorge Otaola; Editing by Adam Jourdan and David GregorioOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Picture taken June 9, 2017. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File PhotoA representative for Lupin, one of India’s top five drugmakers, confirmed at least 18 workers at the manufacturing site in Ankleshwar had tested positive for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. “The persons are under medical care and we are carrying out all contact tracing protocol,” the representative told Reuters in an emailed statement, without elaborating.  “The concerned authorities have been informed and we are working under their guidance for further actions.”  Lupin has 11 manufacturing plants at the Ankleshwar site, which is spread out over 40 acres and has 984 employees, according to the company website. The employees who tested positive work for one of those plants and the rest of the plants are unaffected, said MD Modia, a senior district official.    “The plant was shut on July 12 after the cases were confirmed,” said Modia, adding it had since been sanitized.  Other employees who came into contact with those infected are being tested, another official in the district said. Lupin makes everything from heart drugs to asthma and diabetes medicines that are sold in over 100 countries, with its largest market being North America.  “Lupin remains committed towards ensuring uninterrupted supply of essential medicines and will take the required precautions to ensure a safe and hygienic work environment for its employees,” the company representative said. While the number of infections from the novel coronavirus has been falling in many countries, in India cases have been rising by the thousands in recent weeks.  India had 906,752 cases of the coronavirus with 28,498 new infections reported on Tuesday, according to data from the federal health ministry, the third highest total in the world behind Brazil and the United States.

REUTERS/Stephen Lam(Reuters) - The Kincade wildfire in California’s wine country last October that forced some 2,000 people to flee homes was caused by PG&E Corp’s electrical transmission lines, the state’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said on Thursday. The news comes as a fresh blow to California’s largest utility that emerged from bankruptcy earlier this month, marking an end to a long-drawn restructuring process that began after its equipment sparked some of the deadliest wildfires in the state. Responding to the finding, Pacific Gas and Electric Co said it did not have access to the investigative report or the evidence Cal Fire has collected at this time.  “We look forward to reviewing both at the appropriate time,” the company added.   Tinder dry vegetation and strong winds, combined with low humidity and warm temperatures, contributed to extreme rates of fire spread, which burned a total of 77,758 acres and destroyed more than 370 structures, Cal Fire said in a statement bit.ly/2CHLoCB. The fire investigation report has been forwarded to the Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office, Cal Fire added. The Kincade fire, the worst of several blazes raging throughout California last year, had erupted near the base of a damaged high-voltage transmission tower owned by PG&E, the utility and fire officials had said. The company had in June pleaded guilty to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter stemming from a devastating 2018 wildfire in Northern California touched off by its power lines. The Camp Fire killed at least 84 people, and is considered the most destructive wildfire in California history.

"July 17, 2020",ACRE,"                Exclusive: Pact to aid poor cocoa farmers in peril as COVID-19 hits demand - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsJuly 17, 2020 /  10:29 AM / 4 days agoExclusive: Pact to aid poor cocoa farmers in peril as COVID-19 hits demandMaytaal Angel, Ange Aboa5 Min ReadLONDON/ABIDJAN (Reuters) - The steepest dive in cocoa demand in a decade has thrown into jeopardy a plan by top producers Ivory Coast and Ghana to guarantee some two million farmers a living wage, sources within the countries’ regulators said. FILE PHOTO: A farmer cuts a cocoa pod at a cocoa farm in Bobia, Gagnoa, Ivory Coast, December 6, 2019. REUTERS/Thierry Gouegnon/File PhotoLeading chocolate-makers agreed to a proposal from the African nations last year to charge the industry a premium for cocoa beans and guarantee a minimum income to farmers who earn just $1 a day. But the scheme, set to come into effect this October, was based on expectations that international cocoa prices LCCc2 would stay within average ranges. Instead, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on demand has driven them to their lowest in nearly two years and they are expected to stay weak for at least a year, the industry says. “It is not certain we will be able to guarantee farmers the amount originally expected,” a source at Ivory Coast’s cocoa regulator the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC), which sets the official farmer price each season, told Reuters.  The source, who declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the press, said the country’s cocoa sales for next season were some 30% below average levels for the time of year.  The CCC did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. A spokesman for the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) said in a statement sent via WhatsApp the process of determining the price cocoa farmers will get was ongoing. He added, however, farmers would still get a better price than without any premium. MINIMUM WAGE ERODED Market weakness could appear a good thing for chocolate consumers offered discounts on the high street, but for farmers it could mean hunger. Already the closure of retail outlets during lockdowns to try to contain the novel coronavirus stifled impulse-buying of chocolate, significantly denting demand.  Now widespread economic hardship is expected to limit sales just as the industry anticipates production will rebound when the new cocoa season starts, generating a large global surplus. A series of meetings between representatives of the cocoa industry, Ivory Coast and Ghana last year agreed a premium of $400 a tonne for all sales for the upcoming 2020-21 season, including any production sold ahead of the season’s start in October. Because the market has suffered a sustained fall with prices now below $2,000 a tonne, even with the premium added, the earnings of Ivory Coast and Ghanaian farmers will fall below the guaranteed minimum wage. Four sources in total at Ivory Coast and Ghana’s cocoa regulators, all asking not to be named, predicted the income guarantee would be missed by around $120 a tonne. That would mean farmers get some increase in revenue, but far short of expectations. Calculations made by Ivory Coast and Ghana when the new pricing plan was agreed a year ago showed a $400 premium would allow them to guarantee farmers 70% of a minimum $2,600 a tonne target price from 2020/21 onwards, or about 20% more than they currently receive. Farmers in Ivory Coast and Ghana said they had yet to be told they would receive any less and were counting on an increase for the upcoming season. “Life is hard for us cocoa farmers and if the price is not good, we cannot live well. Everything is expensive and you don’t earn enough to live like men. Here in the village we survive,” Alidou Konate, a farmer with 7 hectares in Duekoue, in western Ivory Coast told Reuters. Francis Yeboah, who has 3 acres in the Ashanti region of Ghana said all farmers had “put a lot of hope in this new pricing system” and it was up to industry and the government to make up the difference in the event of any shortfall. “Even if the coronavirus has an impact on the market and it lowers the price, it is up to the government to find a way to maintain a high price for the poor cocoa farmers that we are. It’s not up to us to make a sacrifice but to the chocolate-makers and the government,” he said. TRADE ALSO ANXIOUS Figures from the industry offer little comfort. An internal report from Barry Callebaut (BARN.S), seen by Reuters, shows the world’s biggest chocolate maker expects a global surplus of 317,000 tonnes in 2020/21, the biggest since 2016/17, when excess supplies kept world prices below $2,000 a tonne for more than a year. Barry Callebaut also adjusted a previously expected 85,000 tonne deficit for 2019/20 to a 6,000 tonne surplus.  Slideshow (4 Images)The company’s sales dropped 14.3% in the April to June quarter. It expects a gradual rebound over the next three years, but it will not be enough to balance the market in 2020/21. It is not just farmers who will suffer. Some traders fear for their livelihoods. “I’m concentrating my efforts on saving my job. Our business is getting impacted. Small trade houses will probably go bankrupt this year,” the head of cocoa trading at a global commodities house said, also asking not to be named.

James Meredith and his wife, Judy, speak with a reporter at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson, Mississippi, U.S., June 19, 2020. REUTERS/Suzi Altman NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVESAt age 87, Jay is as stubborn as ever about his walks. Some days he leaves home in a crisply pressed suit, rolling behind him a hot-pink suitcase he got from a granddaughter who outgrew its color. He uses it to carry his books for sale – many of them self-published and printed at the local Kinko’s. People recognize him, though not as much as they used to. One of Jay’s books, written decades ago, is called “Letters To My Unborn Grandchildren.” Judy and Jay have 11 grandkids now, but he hadn’t always counted on meeting them.  The civil rights years were a dangerous time for Jay. “All I had to lose was my life,” he wrote to them about that period. And he almost had, when he was gunned down by a white man in 1966. This year, life has become dangerous again.  The other day Judy overheard Jay refuse a coronavirus test when his doctor called with concerns. Jay’s picture had appeared in the newspaper. He’d been at the park, talking to a group of suburban white kids wearing Black Lives Matter shirts. His age and diabetes make him vulnerable to the virus. “I’ve just never known Jay to have any fear,” Judy says. Jay says he’ll leave to God how many more walks he’ll take, or how many more days he’ll have with Judy, his wife of 39 years.  She’s 16 years younger, but at 71, Judy is also at high risk. Coronavirus cases have surged in the state since last month, when most Mississippi businesses were allowed to reopen. The majority of Mississippians infected, and killed, have been Black. The virus demands caution, but Judy and Jay haven’t just stayed locked in. America is experiencing a moment of reckoning on race, and they want to bear witness to the changes it brings. One day last month, on Juneteenth, they ventured out to the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. It was still closed because of the pandemic, but the Merediths are always welcome. Some things are familiar about this summer. The grandkids stop by in the daytime, cautiously, and the couple share home-cooked dinners while their dog, Charlie, steals scraps off Jay’s plate. Outside, the magnolia trees have bloomed and the asphalt roads have softened under the heat. But so much else has changed. During the height of a pandemic, people of all skin colors have taken to the streets of Jackson, and cities everywhere, to demand reforms after George Floyd’s killing by a white police officer in Minneapolis. Mississippi has taken down its 126-year-old flag, the last state banner to feature the Confederate battle emblem. On Tuesday, the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, removed a Confederate monument from the center of campus and put it in a Civil War graveyard. Not for the first time, the Merediths see their lives, and those of their family, intersecting with momentous, history-shaping events. In 1965, the Voting Rights Act gave Blacks the vote, but they faced white intimidation against registering. So the next year, Jay undertook a 220-mile solitary “walk against fear,” starting over the Tennessee state line in Memphis. After walking by Elvis Presley’s Graceland mansion and entering Mississippi, he saw a white man waiting with a shotgun off Highway 51. The man, a hardware store clerk, called out his name, and then shot him three times. National radio broke into programming to announce that he was dead. But he was still breathing. Mississippi had a long history of racial violence against Blacks, but this ambush was different: It had all been caught on camera. The image of Jay writhing on the ground transfixed America, much like the video of George Floyd this year. Judy calls her husband Jay. Others in their family call him J-Boy or Uncle J-Boy. But he’s better known, in Mississippi and in history books, as James Meredith.  THE LAST BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR The shooting wasn’t Jay’s first time in the line of fire. In December 1962, Bob Dylan recorded the song “Oxford Town” about him. At the time, Dylan was still an up-and-coming musician and Meredith was one of the most hated and admired men in America. He went down to Oxford Town Guns and clubs followed him down All because his face was brown Better get away from Oxford Town That year, Meredith had orchestrated one of the biggest victories of the American civil rights era when he became the first Black to attend Ole Miss in Oxford. The school had been an all-white bastion of the Old South. The segregationist governor, Democrat Ross Barnett, had arrived on the scene to block Meredith’s entry himself. White mobs in Oxford wanted him dead. But Meredith, an Air Force veteran, compelled the federal government to send more than 30,000 U.S. troops to uphold his right as a citizen to attend. He had created one of the tensest moments of John F. Kennedy’s presidency. Some historians have likened it to the last battle of the Civil War. Growing up in Gary, Indiana, Judy watched these events on TV. “Let’s see if James Meredith survived another day,” she remembers her father saying when he turned on the nightly news. Judy remembers her church preacher asking congregants to pray for Meredith, and she had. She also remembers her mother and aunt talking about him. “That James Meredith is one good-looking man,” they used to say. “I thought that was the best reality TV ever made,” Judy says. It was one of the reasons she embarked on a career in broadcast journalism. What Jay did at Ole Miss has opened the doors for Judy, too. In their living room, Dr. Judy Meredith takes down her PhD degree from Mississippi State University to demonstrate. She’s been a TV news reporter and anchor, a Fulbright scholar, a music teacher, a university professor. Today, Judy and Jay live in Jackson’s Fondren neighborhood, a leafy, mostly white upper-middle-class area. Still, huge racial disparities remain in the state. These are evident, Judy says, in the surge of coronavirus cases among Blacks here, a sign of enduring economic and health deficits. Blacks make up 38% of the state’s population, but they’ve accounted for 54% of positive tests and half of all deaths among cases in which race has been reported. Things have grown dire this week, with many of the state’s intensive-care units already reaching capacity and Republican Gov. Tate Reeves entreating Mississippians to mask up. The divides are also on display at public schools. Many in Jackson are nearly all Black, and others in the suburbs nearly all white. Even at Ole Miss, Blacks still make up only 13% of the student body. In other ways, Judy says, it’s more subtle. As an older Black woman in the Deep South, she’s noticed something at the supermarket and in department stores: White women coming down the aisles expect her to move out of their way, she says. She’s mentioned this to friends, white ladies she lunches with. Sometimes she is met with blank stares. “They do it without even noticing,” Judy says. In recent years, Judy has begun playing a polite Southern game of chicken with white ladies at the stores. She’s all smiles, but she stands her ground and waits for them to move out of her way. Recently, during long hours at home, Judy has been moved to tears when the couple watch George Floyd’s killing. The footage has been inescapable. “It is terrible, disgusting,” Judy says. But she has trouble understanding why it has prompted such an outpouring. Why now? There have been many other videos depicting police brutality against Blacks. None of them sent millions of protesters into the streets or brought down the Mississippi flag. Jay says he knows why. The fuse was lit, this time, not just by Floyd’s death, but by lockdowns, soaring unemployment, hunger, pent-up anger. “The pandemic,” he says, “set up America for an explosion.” A FUNERAL AND A WEDDING At the Civil Rights Museum, Judy does most of the talking. Even though the place is shut to visitors, a sound system is pumping loud spiritual music, and Jay’s hearing is going. “I’m happy to be a sideshow,” he says. He’s also wary. Few reporters have ever understood him, he says, admitting that he likes to confound people. One exception, he says, was the late Bill Minor, often considered the dean of Mississippi journalism. (The observation people remember by Minor – the one uttered through the Southern grapevine ever since – is this one: “James Meredith is crazy.” It’s something Jay doesn’t exactly deny, either. Back at Ole Miss, he’d trained himself never to blink when whites threw firecrackers at his feet.) But at their home the next day, they both wax on during an interview that lasts four hours – at a safe social distance. They describe how they met, in 1981. Jay was on his way to a funeral in Indiana. Two years earlier, his first wife, Mary June, had died of a heart attack at age 41, leaving Jay with three boys to raise. Judy was a single mother too, with a son from an earlier marriage. If she was starstruck by the man she’d watched on TV two decades earlier, she didn’t show it that day. “I didn’t want him getting any ideas,” she says. He got ideas anyway. Later, at the funeral in Indiana, he peered at the casket and then turned to their mutual friend: “Ain’t nothing I can do for this man, so take me back to that woman.” For the next several weeks, Judy and Jay courted over long-distance calls that lasted until dawn. They exchanged family histories, and bonded over their childhoods, so similar even though they came from North and South, city and country. They debated current events. Judy was sharp, not shy about challenging Jay. She reminded him of his mother, Miss Roxie, a proud “belle of the county” who took no sass from Jay, his nine siblings, or anyone else. “I ain’t never told nobody this,” Jay says. “But I have one of the biggest egos in the world.” At that, Judy says, “Mmmm-hmmm.” They married 10 weeks after they met. Early in their life together, there were times when she bristled at his stubbornness. She left once, back to Gary. Jay went north and won her back. “Now every time I leave home, I check to make sure she’s still here,” he says. Last year, Judy finished a short documentary about her husband called “Who Is James Meredith?” Before the pandemic hit, it was having a good run at film festivals. Given their age difference, she seems aware that she will likely be a torchbearer for his legacy. It’s a complicated one. At many turns, Jay has inflamed civil rights groups and would-be supporters. He’s never wanted to be part of a movement, often preferring individual action or lone “walks” to collective marches. Some of his actions have been unorthodox, to say the least. Like the time in the 1990s he supported David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, for governor of Louisiana. Or when, earlier, he’d endorsed the reelection of Mississippi Gov. Barnett, the man who’d tried to block his way at Ole Miss. He says everything he’s done in life has followed a plan – a “divine mission” – to dismantle white supremacy, including by showing no fear to its figureheads. In politics, he wants Blacks to know what they’re up against.  “I prefer bigotry to be out in the open where I can confront it,” he wrote to his unborn grandkids. He has also courted controversy with speeches that veer into performance art. One time, in a talk at his alma mater Ole Miss, he played the song “Shake Your Money Maker” by Mississippi bluesman Elmore James, breaking into dance moves and telling students it was the most important thing they could learn about the Black experience in America. Everybody knows what the song is about, Jay says, but nobody wants to say it. “I ain’t gonna say it,” Judy says. “It means you gotta shake your booty,” Jay says, bursting into a laugh that detaches his dentures from his gums. A FAMILY AFFAIR For all Jay’s “lone wolf” agitation and egotism over the years, what’s most important to him is family. Both he and Judy grew up in families that went to extremes to shield them, as children, from the ugliness of racism. Judy, born to a Black father and white mother, had been given up at birth. She was adopted at age 3 by parents from East Texas who had migrated north, like millions of other Blacks. She grew up within earshot of the childhood home of Michael Jackson. The sound of the Jackson 5’s daily band practices filled the street. “You couldn’t not hear them,” she says. Her own gift for music was evident before kindergarten, and she spent her childhood almost always near a piano, at home, church and school. It was a sheltered existence, and Judy says her parents “never talked about race relations.”  She remembers one moment when reality intruded, while riding with her mother on a trip down to East Texas. “This little white boy, riding a bike, called my mom n—-er,” she says. “She hollered out the window, ‘Peckerwood,’ but we didn’t talk about it; she didn’t stop to tell me what was going on.” Jay was raised on an 84-acre farm in Kosciusko, Mississippi (perhaps best known these days as the hometown of Oprah Winfrey). His father, Cap, instructed Jay that nothing could hold him back and he would be called upon to lead. As the Black owner of a sizable farm, Cap was well off for his time. He built fences several feet inside the property line so they could be maintained without bickering with white neighbors, with whom Jay had scarce contact. Jay remembers the exact moment, at age 15, when he discovered that Southern whites viewed him as inferior.  It was on a 1948 train ride back from a family road trip to Chicago. When the train reached Memphis, the conductor ordered him and his brother to leave their seats, for which they’d paid full fare, and go stand in the “colored car.”  Jay says he cried all the way back to Mississippi.  “I cried, but I also started scheming.”  Scheming, he says, to accept no Mississippi in which he or his kind could be degraded, just as his father, Cap, had done with his farm. He talks at length about earlier generations, what they endured, inherited and passed down. “Most of my life happened before I was born,” Jay says. Judy and Jay share a vision of family as a relay of sorts, over the arc of time, in which each generation can, and must, seize a new set of gains. Their son Joseph personified this, graduating summa cum laude from Harvard and later winning the outstanding doctoral student award at Ole Miss. Twelve years ago, Joseph died of lupus at age 39. A NEW GENERATION AT “NEW MISS” In one of his letters to his grandchildren, Jay wrote: “Life in America is combat.” Ole Miss was a war zone when Meredith arrived in Oxford in 1962. Thousands of white men, many of them armed, faced off against outnumbered federal marshals, the night sky illuminated by explosions. Two people died, hundreds were injured, and Jay slept through it all in a dorm room. Today, Judy and Jay think of Mississippi not only as home but as “the center of the universe.” This might seem improbable. It’s the poorest of the 50 U.S. states, with the lowest life expectancy. People in Jackson sometimes joke that its streets have potholes big enough to catch catfish from. But when change comes to Mississippi, the couple say, it has a tendency to reverberate elsewhere. “Nobody wants to be behind Mississippi,” Jay says. In a generation, Mississippi has gone from the epitome of segregation to a place where scores of Ole Miss students and alumni approach Jay for handshakes or autographs when the couple attend a football game there. Never mind, Judy says, that a few of the alumni might have yelled the N-word at Jay back in 1962. In 2006, Judy and Jay attended the unveiling of a statue of him on campus. At first, he had mixed feelings about the statue. For one, he wasn’t invited to the podium to speak at the ceremony. (The actor Morgan Freeman was among those enlisted to talk about him instead. Asked about the unveiling, an Ole Miss representative said, “James Meredith is one of our most notable alumni; however, we are not able to confirm those details from the event from 14 years ago.”) In 2014, the statue was defaced by white students who placed a noose around its neck along with a Confederate symbol. Afterward, a Black student guarded the statue for months, holding a daily vigil. It has become a popular gathering and protest spot for students, most recently in protective face masks.  Slideshow (4 Images)“The past is never dead. It’s not even past,” wrote another Ole Miss alumnus and a son of Oxford, the novelist William Faulkner. The writer died just a few months before Meredith’s arrival on campus in 1962, but his nephew was in a National Guard unit deployed to protect Meredith. He was attacked by rioters throwing bricks and broke an arm. Judy and Jay have a granddaughter, Jylah Meredith Knight, who plans to start as a freshman at Ole Miss in the fall. It isn’t yet clear whether it will be safe for Jylah to attend classes on campus, but unlike her grandfather, she’s in the same predicament as all students. It’s a virus, this time, that has changed everything.

Chevron (CVX.N) said on Monday it would buy oil and gas producer Noble Energy Inc (NBL.O) for about $5 billion in stock, the first big energy deal since the coronavirus crisis started. “The crystal ball is cloudy right now,” Mike Wirth said in an interview. “There’s so much uncertainty on the trajectory of the pandemic, the rate of development of effective vaccines and government policy interventions to try to manage risk between here and there. It’s a fluid environment. We expect choppy economic and price activity.” But Chevron expects long-term demand growth for natural gas from population growth and needs to lower greenhouse gas emissions, Wirth said. The deal boosts the company’s natural gas portfolio with Noble’s flagship Leviathan field in Israel, the largest natural gas field in the eastern Mediterranean. Noble’s holdings also include shale properties in Colorado and in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, where Noble’s 92,000 acres (37,230 hectares)is a “a nice but undersized Permian position” that compliments Chevron’s existing land, Wirth said.

Leading chocolate-makers agreed to a proposal from the African nations last year to charge the industry a premium for cocoa beans and guarantee a minimum income to farmers who earn just $1 a day. But the scheme, set to come into effect this October, was based on expectations that international cocoa prices would stay within average ranges. Instead, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on demand has driven them to their lowest in nearly two years and they are expected to stay weak for at least a year, the industry says. “It is not certain we will be able to guarantee farmers the amount originally expected,” a source at Ivory Coast’s cocoa regulator the Coffee and Cocoa Council (CCC), which sets the official farmer price each season, told Reuters. The source, who declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the press, said the country’s cocoa sales for next season were some 30% below average levels for the time of year. The CCC did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. A spokesman for the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) said in a statement sent via WhatsApp the process of determining the price cocoa farmers will get was ongoing. He added, however, farmers would still get a better price than without any premium. MINIMUM WAGE ERODED Market weakness could appear a good thing for chocolate consumers offered discounts on the high street, but for farmers it could mean hunger. Already the closure of retail outlets during lockdowns to try to contain the novel coronavirus stifled impulse-buying of chocolate, significantly denting demand. Now widespread economic hardship is expected to limit sales just as the industry anticipates production will rebound when the new cocoa season starts, generating a large global surplus. A series of meetings between representatives of the cocoa industry, Ivory Coast and Ghana last year agreed a premium of $400 a tonne for all sales for the upcoming 2020-21 season, including any production sold ahead of the season’s start in October. Because the market has suffered a sustained fall with prices now below $2,000 a tonne, even with the premium added, the earnings of Ivory Coast and Ghanaian farmers will fall below the guaranteed minimum wage. Four sources in total at Ivory Coast and Ghana’s cocoa regulators, all asking not to be named, predicted the income guarantee would be missed by around $120 a tonne. That would mean farmers get some increase in revenue, but far short of expectations. Calculations made by Ivory Coast and Ghana when the new pricing plan was agreed a year ago showed a $400 premium would allow them to guarantee farmers 70% of a minimum $2,600 a tonne target price from 2020/21 onwards, or about 20% more than they currently receive. Farmers in Ivory Coast and Ghana said they had yet to be told they would receive any less and were counting on an increase for the upcoming season. “Life is hard for us cocoa farmers and if the price is not good, we cannot live well. Everything is expensive and you don’t earn enough to live like men. Here in the village we survive,” Alidou Konate, a farmer with 7 hectares in Duekoue, in western Ivory Coast told Reuters. Francis Yeboah, who has 3 acres in the Ashanti region of Ghana said all farmers had “put a lot of hope in this new pricing system” and it was up to industry and the government to make up the difference in the event of any shortfall. “Even if the coronavirus has an impact on the market and it lowers the price, it is up to the government to find a way to maintain a high price for the poor cocoa farmers that we are. It’s not up to us to make a sacrifice but to the chocolate-makers and the government,” he said. TRADE ALSO ANXIOUS Figures from the industry offer little comfort. An internal report from Barry Callebaut, seen by Reuters, shows the world’s biggest chocolate maker expects a global surplus of 317,000 tonnes in 2020/21, the biggest since 2016/17, when excess supplies kept world prices below $2,000 a tonne for more than a year. Barry Callebaut also adjusted a previously expected 85,000 tonne deficit for 2019/20 to a 6,000 tonne surplus. The company’s sales dropped 14.3% in the April to June quarter. It expects a gradual rebound over the next three years, but it will not be enough to balance the market in 2020/21. It is not just farmers who will suffer. Some traders fear for their livelihoods. “I’m concentrating my efforts on saving my job. Our business is getting impacted. Small trade houses will probably go bankrupt this year,” the head of cocoa trading at a global commodities house said, also asking not to be named. $1 = 0.7965 poundsAdditional reporting by Silke Koltrowitz in Zurich; Editing by Veronica Brown,Nigel Hunt and Barbara LewisOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

FILE PHOTO: Ryanair logo is pictured on the the jacket of a cabin crew member ahead of a news conference by Ryanair union representatives in Brussels, Belgium September 13, 2018.   REUTERS/Francois LenoirUnions in Ireland, Britain, Spain and Portugal have announced plans to strike in the coming weeks, a year after a wave of strikes over pay and conditions forced Europe’s largest budget carrier to cancel hundreds of flights.  Ryanair has said it expects minimal disruption from the walkouts which are scheduled to begin with a five-day strike by Portuguese cabin crew trade union SNPVAC. It said on Tuesday that a small number of flights from its Portuguese bases may be affected by minor schedule changes for five days from Aug. 21 and that all affected customers had already been notified. In the letter to Ryanair, the two Belgian unions said cabin crew and pilots stationed in Belgium had been asked to staff some affected flights. “Unfortunately we had to conclude that Ryanair decided to import the conflict that is going on in Portugal to Belgium... We cannot agree with this state of affairs and will therefore call on our members not to staff these flights,” they said. A spokesman for Portugal’s SNPVAC union said it had received information that flights will be operated by crews from other bases and that this was a “violation of the right to strike.” Ryanair managed to quell last year’s disputes by striking pay deals with many staff in Europe after agreeing to recognize trade unions for the first time, but it has failed to do so with others and further angered unions by telling staff last month that it had 900 more pilots and crew than it needed. Unions representing cabin crew in Spain said their plans for 10 days of strikes next month still stood after more than seven hours of mediated talks with the airline ended on Tuesday without agreement. The SITCPLA and USO workers’ unions’ threat of strike action is aimed at preventing closure of bases at Girona, Gran Canaria, and Tenerife South airports. The unions said on Tuesday that it had still not received any information on the base closures. Ryanair’s chief people officer told Reuters last week that the Gran Canaria and Tenerife South would likely close as part of plans to cut is presence on the ground in airports due to delays in the delivery of the grounded Boeing 737 MAX. A final decision had yet to be made on how many bases, jobs and routes would be cut, he added.

FILE PHOTO: Passengers board a Ryanair flight at the airport in Gdansk, Poland, June 19, 2019. REUTERS/Kevin Coombs/File PhotoRyanair is battling to prevent employees from taking industrial action. Last year strikes over pay and conditions forced the Irish airline to cancel hundreds of flights. Ryanair welcomed the Irish High Court ruling, saying all flights scheduled to depart on Aug. 22 and 23 from Irish airports would operate as normal. But the airline said it regretted the decision by under 30% of its UK pilots to strike on Thursday and Friday in “support of unreasonable pay demands.” After the High Court decided against granting Ryanair an injunction to prevent the strike, the British pilots’ union BALPA offered to call off the action if the airline agreed to a new framework of talks.  However, Ryanair turned down the offer and the British union said the strike will go ahead. “Ryanair foolishly tried to stop our strike in the High Court today and failed. Despite that, we extended an olive branch to Ryanair as a way of getting back around the table and calling off strikes over the next two days,” Strutton said in a statement. Separately, a five-day strike by Ryanair’s cabin crew in Portugal is underway but disruption to passengers appeared minimal, with no canceled flights or major delays. In a statement released on Wednesday afternoon, Ryanair said more staff than needed showed up to work at Portuguese airports on Wednesday morning and there would be no significant disruption to flights to and from the country during the rest of the day. Portugal’s SNPVAC cabin crew trade union met with the Portuguese Minister of Infrastructure and Housing on Wednesday to discuss the labor situation, including the impact of the possible closure of Ryanair’s base in Faro.  SNPVAC president Luciana Passos said 70%-80% of crew members were currently on strike, though there were no major delays or cancellations at Lisbon, Porto and Faro airports.      “This (strike) is an attempt to once again draw attention to the problems faced by Ryanair crew members, to the way Ryanair operates in Portugal and the total impunity with which Ryanair operates,” Passos said.     Ryanair’s management says significant progress has been made since last year’s strikes, with collective labor agreements concluded with a number of pilot unions throughout Europe. But SNPVAC said Ryanair had refused to comply with a protocol signed last November, which it said included holiday pay, 22 days of annual leave per year and full compliance with Portuguese parental law. At the height of the summer season, Portugal’s government set out a minimum service for Ryanair and its staff to deliver, including a daily round trip between Lisbon and London.  SNPVAC said the minimum service order was “abusive” and  undermined the right to strike. Belgium’s CNE and ACV PULS unions told members on Tuesday not to comply with a Ryanair request to staff flights affected by the Portuguese action.  Spain’s STICPLA union also sent a letter to members,  advising they were not obliged to “answer company calls” if they were in their rest time, on days off or on holiday.  Unions representing cabin crew in Spain said their plans for 10 days of strikes next month still stood after more than seven hours of mediated talks with the airline ended on Tuesday without agreement.

The five-day strike called by Portugal’s SNPVAC union is the first of a wave of planned walkouts by unions in Ireland, Britain and Spain. It comes a year after strikes over pay and conditions forced Europe’s largest low cost carrier to cancel hundreds of flights. Ryanair said on Tuesday a small number of fights from its Portuguese bases might be affected by minor schedule changes and that affected customers had been notified.

RNG did not include Uzi on their lineup released Monday for the 2020 LPL Summer Split. Lu “Betty” Yu-Hung is the only ADC listed on the eight-man roster. It was reported last month that Uzi’s contract with RNG had expired and there has been speculation that he might retire. The 23-year-old has been plagued by wrist injuries and did not compete during the Chinese league’s Spring Split. Uzi, a two-time silver medalist at the World Championships, first was part of the organization in 2012 when it was named Royal Club. He departed in 2014 and returned two years later. —Field Level MediaOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

FILE PHOTO: General view outside GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) headquarters in Brentford, following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), London, Britain, May 4, 2020. REUTERS/Matthew ChildsApproval for belantamab mafodotin as a treatment for multiple myeloma is seen as important for GSK’s growing oncology portfolio. The drug is a rival to Johnson & Johnson and Genmab’s Darzalex treatment.     The FDA will now make a final decision on the treatment. While the agency is not bound to follow the recommendation of its advisory panel, it usually does. “We are committed to working closely with the FDA to complete the review of belantamab mafodotin for these patients who have limited treatment options,” a GSK spokesperson said. The FDA had on Friday raised safety concerns over how the treatment can cause deposits to gather on the cornea, known as keratopathy. GSK had said it was confident in the benefit/risk profile of the drug, and proposed that it should be managed through modifying or interrupting the course of treatment. In its mid-stage study DREAMM-2, nearly 100 patients were given the drug at the dosage for which GSK has submitted for approval.  Of them, 31% showed a meaningful response to the treatment, indicating its efficacy, but 27% experienced medically severe keratopathy. One patient discontinued treatment due to the side-effect but no patients experienced life threatening symptoms. GSK’s experimental treatment belongs to a promising class of drugs called antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) and poses a challenge to the dominance of J&J-Genmad owned Darzalex with its approval. ADCs link powerful cell toxins to antibodies that cling to cancer cells, sparing the healthy cells that are damaged during conventional chemotherapy treatments. Belantamab mafodotin targets the BCMA protein in cells characteristic of multiple myeloma - an area of focus for many drugmakers.

"March 11, 2019",ADT,"                Home security firm ADT's outlook disappoints, shares fall 10 percent - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States March 11, 2019 /  8:18 PM / a year agoHome security firm ADT's outlook disappoints, shares fall 10 percent3 Min Read(Reuters) - ADT Inc reported a quarterly loss and forecast 2019 revenue and EBITDA below Wall Street estimates amid intensifying competition from fast-growing do-it-yourself home security offerings such as Google Nest. ADT’s shares fell more than 10 percent in after-hours trading. Security products such as Google Nest, SimpliSafe and Frontpoint can be self-installed, have a lower monthly fee and may or may not be monitored by a third party. These products compete with ADT’s Pulse, which allows users to monitor and manage their home remotely. ADT’s 2019 free cash flow growth forecast of 6 percent to 13 percent was a sharp deceleration from the more than 33 percent growth in 2018, as the company invests $40 million this year in initiatives such as branding to counter competition and hiring staff to expand its business. “We will make selective brand investments and we continue to solidify ADT’s position as the leader in home automation and security,” Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Likosar said on a conference call. ADT has expanded its home security and commercial security offering through acquisitions over the past few months.  The company bought do-it-yourself home security provider Lifeshield for about $25 million in February and purchased Advanced Cabling Systems - a provider of fire alarm and video surveillance systems - in January. ADT said it expects 2019 revenue in a range of $4.90 billion to $5.10 billion, largely below the average analyst estimate of $4.92 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company’s full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) outlook of between $2.46 billion and $2.50 billion was also below Wall Street expectations of $2.56 billion. ADT reported a net loss of $149 million, or 20 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $638 million, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier, when it recorded a benefit due to the U.S. tax reform. ADT took a goodwill impairment charge of $88 million in 2018 due to underperformance of its Canadian business. Revenue rose 7.1 to $1.19 billion.

REUTERS/Chris Wattie (Reuters) - Telus Corp (T.TO) said on Tuesday it would buy home security provider ADT Inc’s (ADT.N) Canadian operations for C$700 million ($527.27 million), as the telecommunications provider builds out its security business.      The Canadian company last year launched its smarthome security and secure businesses and expects to add more than 12,000 new customer to its security business in the third quarter. ADT Canada provides security and automation solutions to a customer base of about 500,000 and reported revenue of $229 million in 2018. The deal with ADT Canada is expected to close in the fourth quarter, the company said.

"July 3, 2019",ADT,"                Risk of dementia rises with prostate cancer hormone-blocking therapy - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Sports NewsJuly 3, 2019 /  9:02 PM / a year agoRisk of dementia rises with prostate cancer hormone-blocking therapyLinda Carroll5 Min ReadProstate cancer patients who received hormone-lowering therapy were at higher risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer’s disease later on than men who didn’t get this treatment, a large U.S. study finds. Researchers who followed nearly 155,000 men with prostate cancer found that overall, those given so-called androgen-deprivation therapy were at a 20% higher risk of being diagnosed with dementia and at 14% higher risk of an Alzheimer’s diagnosis in the next 10 years. The risk continued to rise with increasing doses of androgen-deprivation drugs.   The results suggest that in cases where the prostate cancer is localized, androgen-deprivation therapy may not be a good choice, said the study’s lead author, Ravishankar Jayadevappa, a research associate professor in the department of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine in Philadelphia.  Even in patients at high risk, there needs to be a discussion about the elevated risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease during long-term follow-up, Jayadevappa said.  The most common androgens found in the male body are testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). According to the American Cancer Society, doctors may choose to prescribe androgen-lowering therapy because it can result in slower growth - or even shrinkage - of prostate tumors. Studies on the cognitive impacts of androgen-deprivation therapy have had mixed results, Jayadevappa and his colleagues note in JAMA Network Open. In an attempt to arrive at a more definitive result, the researchers pored over data from a National Cancer Institute database that collects information on cancer incidence, treatment and mortality from 18 sites, encompassing 28% of the U.S. population, and links it with Medicare data.  The researchers focused on men who were aged 66 and older and diagnosed with localized or advanced prostate cancer between 1996 and 2003. The men were followed until 2013, so all had at least 10 years of follow-up. Out of 154,089 men in the study, 62,330 received androgen deprivation therapy within two years of their diagnosis. The study team found that 13.1% of men who got hormone-lowering therapy and 9.4% of those who didn’t were diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease during the follow-up period. Similarly, 21.6% of those who got androgen deprivation and 15.8% of those who didn’t were diagnosed with other forms of dementia.  Greater exposure was also tied to greater risk: Men who got one to four doses of androgen deprivation therapy had a 19% higher risk for Alzheimer’s or dementia, while those who had eight or more doses had a 24% higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s and a 21% higher risk of developing dementia.  Dr. Catherine Marshall welcomed the new study. “We know there are many negative side effects of ADT (androgen-deprivation therapy), including many long-term side effects,” said Marshall, an assistant professor at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, Maryland. “While this question of a link between ADT and Alzheimer’s disease and dementia has been explored before, this is quite possibly the largest study to address this issue. Because of that, it adds important information about the risk of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia for men being treated.” Studies like this one are very important because “our clinical trials are not always as long as this study and may not capture the long-term consequences of these treatments,” Marshall said in an email. “Delaying the start of ADT until the disease is more advanced may be a reasonable option for many men and would help to ultimately shorten the total duration of treatment.” The new study is very interesting and “it may lead to prevention trials for Alzheimer’s disease,” said Dr. Oscar Lopez, director of the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer Disease Research Center in Pennsylvania.  But there are some caveats, Lopez said in an email. “The use of a Medicare database to determine the presence of Alzheimer’s disease is a limitation since the mild cases are usually not captured by these types of registries,” he said.

Dana Gas, which operates concessions Iraq’s Kurdish region and Egypt, said it was studying a potential demerger of the business into a new company, according to a statement to the stock exchange. Should the transaction succeed, shareholders in Dana Gas will own shares in the two companies, the company said. Spinning off businesses typically allows the parent company and the spin-off alike to focus better on their respective strategies, while investors tend to value both more highly due to greater transparency. “The management probably sees that the sum of the parts is larger than the holding company, so they are trying to unlock some of that value, where shareholders can realize that value as well,” said Mohammed Ali Yasin, chief strategy officer at Al Dhabi Capital Ltd. in Abu Dhabi. “As a long term investor, maybe that could prove a diversification of investment for investors if listed on the ADX, for UAE, Gulf investors who would like more exposure into the oil sector,” Yasin said. It would be a boost for the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange, which has not seen an equity offering since the listing of ADNOC Distribution in 2017. Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala Investment Co’s chief executive Khaldoon al-Mubarak said in October that Mubadala had an interest in encouraging initial public offerings in the UAE’s market and it has companies that could be listed locally. Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is considering offering exchangeable bonds that could be converted into shares of ADNOC Distribution, as one option for increasing the free float of the listed unit. In February, Dana said it has received bids from some companies for its assets in Egypt and that a final decision on the potential sale was expected by the end of March.

The company will have 500 million dirhams ($136.15 million) in capital funds divided into 500 million shares, as well as 100 million dirhams in export capital divided into 100 million shares. ADQ is the new brand of the Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company, one of the region’s largest holding companies. “The newly regulated company will also be responsible for managing and organising the securities market, and enlisting and dealing in securities, depositing, settlements and central clearinghouse works,” the government’s media office said on Twitter. It will also be in charge of providing, preparing and managing securities dealing platforms and providing services to exporters and brokers, as well as “financial services and products related to the operational and commercial activities of the market.” United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan signed a law to enact the change. $1 = 3.6724 UAE dirhamReporting by Alaa Swilam; writing by Saeed Azhar and YousefSaba; editing by Louise Heavens, Larry KingOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

"May 12, 2020",AEB,"                'Black April' for Russia's car market as sales plunge 72% - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsMay 12, 2020 /  9:11 AM / 2 months ago'Black April' for Russia's car market as sales plunge 72%2 Min ReadMOSCOW (Reuters) - Sales of new cars in Russia plummeted by 72.4% in April compared with a year earlier, the Association of European Businesses (AEB) said on Tuesday, as the coronavirus outbreak slowed production and halted some dealer operations. Just 38,922 new cars and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia in April, which saw the biggest monthly sales fall ever recorded by AEB after a 4% rise the previous month.  The most popular were Lada cars, made by Avtovaz, which accounted for around a quarter of April sales with 9,396 units. April was part of a non-working period in Russia, ordered by President Vladimir Putin to stop the spread of the coronavirus, bringing the economy to a halt as factories and businesses were forced to suspend operations and citizens asked to self-isolate.  “‘Black April’ 2020 strongly challenged dealer liquidity and mid-term even their sustainability,” said Thomas Staertzel,  AEB Automobile Manufacturers Committee chairman. “Dealers are preparing for a restart, although I do not expect much better sales results in May.” People rushed to buy cars in March, with sales jumping 22.7% as they expected prices to rise after a fall in the rouble due to lower oil prices and the coronavirus outbreak, analytical agency Autostat said last month. Russia has reported 232,243 coronavirus cases and 2,116 deaths.

New car sales in Russia this year are set to fall 2.1%, AEB said in January. Following the decision by BMW and Mercedes-Benz to change the frequency of their sales data publication from a monthly to a quarterly basis, the AEB said February’s figures did not include data for either BMW or Mercedes-Benz Rus. “For a correct year-on-year comparison, sales data for the BMW, MINI, Mercedes-Benz, smart, Mercedes-Benz Vans brands in 2019 is not shown in this press release.” The AEB said it would begin publishing a quarterly sales report to reflect the sales data for those manufacturers in April. It was not clear whether this would be an additional report or would replace the existing monthly sales release.

"April 7, 2020",AEB,"                Rouble crash fuels 22.7% jump in Russian passenger car sales in March - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Credit RSSApril 7, 2020 /  3:46 PM / 3 months agoRouble crash fuels 22.7% jump in Russian passenger car sales in MarchGleb Stolyarov3 Min ReadMOSCOW, April 7 (Reuters) - Russia’s passenger car sales jumped by 22.7% in March, compared with the previous year, as consumers rushed to buy new vehicles ahead of anticipated price rises following the rouble’s sharp fall, analytical agency Autostat said on Tuesday. However, with car dealerships now closed across the country as a precaution against the spread of the coronavirus and only online trading available, sales are expected to dive in April. Uncertainty caused by the global coronavirus epidemic and low oil prices in the wake of an OPEC+ deal over oil output falling apart last month have made the rouble one of the world's worst-performing currencies here against the dollar this year, losing around 20% of its value. The Association of European Businesses (AEB) on Monday postponed the release of its March car sales statistics indefinitely, citing the “prolongation of the non-working period” in Russia, ordered by President Vladimir Putin until April 30 to curb the spread of infections. Autostat, which also monitors the market, said sales of passenger cars in March rose to 160,640 units, and increased by 16.3% to 375,649 in the first quarter year-on-year. The explosive growth is primarily due to expectations of a rise in prices because of the rouble’s fall, and a desire to buy a car at the old price, Autostat’s Executive Director Sergei Udalov told Reuters. “There will be a downturn, and it will be severe,” Udalov said, adding that the decline in sales in April could reach as much as 80%-90%. Russia has reported 7,497 cases of coronavirus and 58 deaths, while a self-isolation regime imposed in Moscow is gradually being rolled out across other regions. Car sales began to slow in the last week of March, when the self-isolation regime was introduced, Udalov said and predicted a slow market recovery when the non-working period is over as prices will have risen. In March, Russian inflation accelerated to 2.5% year-on-year. The only chance of a recovery will be with domestic producers, who can keep prices lower thanks to having assembly parts produced locally, he said.
