"December 19, 2018",aapl,"                100 days to Brexit, EU tells London: financiers on their own without a deal - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States World NewsDecember 19, 2018 /  9:01 AM / 2 years ago100 days to Brexit, EU tells London: financiers on their own without a dealGuy Faulconbridge, Huw Jones4 Min ReadLONDON (Reuters) - With just 100 days until Brexit, the EU’s executive cautioned that most banking, insurance and other financial firms in Britain would be cut off from the European Union if there is no divorce deal. Prime Minister Theresa May’s failure to find a deal the British parliament will approve means the world’s fifth largest economy now faces three main choices: agreeing a last-minute deal, halting Brexit or leaving the EU without a deal. No deal means there would be no transition so the exit, set in law as 2300 GMT on March 29, would be abrupt. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said leaving the EU with no transition could be akin to the 1970s oil shock. With fears growing that the political brinkmanship in London could lead, as May has warned, to Britain leaving without a deal, businesses and the EU’s executive ramped up planning for such an eventuality. “Businesses of all sizes are reaching the point of no return, with many now putting in place contingency plans that are a significant drain of time and money,” the heads of Britain’s five biggest business lobby groups said. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said a disorderly Brexit would be an “absolute catastrophe”.

Morgan (JPM.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N), have cautioned that Brexit could complicate their businesses. The euro notched up its biggest daily rise against the pound in more than a week on Wednesday. “The government is playing a very hardball game ... as it delays the Brexit vote until the New Year, which is curtailing the debate over May’s plan and effectively giving little time for alternatives to be found,” Scotiabank said in a note. May has delayed a vote on her deal until mid-January, prompting some lawmakers to accuse her of trying to force parliament into backing her by running down the clock as the March 29 exit day approaches. NO DEAL BREXIT? The European Union set out short-term measures to limit disruption to air traffic, financial services and trade if Britain left without a deal.

REUTERS/Toby MelvilleEvery shipment of live animals or animal products from Britain would face controls at EU borders and Britons would lose the right to travel with their pets using EU pet passports. Pro-Europeans fear Britain’s exit will weaken the West as it grapples with Donald Trump’s unpredictable U.S. presidency and growing assertiveness from Russia and China. They say it weakens Europe’s economy and removes one of its only two nuclear powers. Brexit supporters say while there may be some short-term disruption, in the long-term the UK will thrive outside what they cast as a doomed experiment in German-dominated unity and excessive debt-funded welfare spending. Without a deal, the United Kingdom would trade with the European Union under World Trade Organization terms. But without a transition, London - which ranks alongside New York as one of the world’s top two global financial centers - would be cut off from the rest of the EU. About six trillion euros, or 37 percent, of Europe’s financial assets are managed in the UK capital, almost twice the amount of its nearest rival, Paris. In addition, London dominates Europe’s 5.2 trillion euro investment banking industry. New York is bigger, but centered on American markets.

The Labour Party said Corbyn used the words “stupid people”. The British government set out the biggest overhaul of its immigration policy in decades on Wednesday, ending special treatment for European Union nationals while promising to give businesses time to adapt to its post-Brexit plans.

"May 15, 2020",aapl,"                Foxconn quarterly profit hits two-decade low, sees growth from post-virus lifestyles - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Technology NewsMay 15, 2020 /  6:34 AM / 2 months agoFoxconn quarterly profit hits two-decade low, sees growth from post-virus lifestylesYimou Lee, Ben Blanchard3 Min ReadTAIPEI (Reuters) - Foxconn’s (2317.TW) first-quarter profit plunged to its lowest in two decades, all but wiped out, after the coronavirus pandemic forced the Taiwanese firm to suspend manufacturing operations in China and knocked demand from customers including Apple Inc AAPL.0. FILE PHOTO: A motorcyclist rides past the logo of Foxconn, the trading name of Hon Hai Precision Industry, in Taipei, Taiwan March 30, 2018. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/File PhotoBut the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said the worst of the virus outbreak for the company was over.  New growth was to be found in the work-from-home lifestyles being adopted around the world even if the outlook for smartphone and other consumer electronics demand remained bleak, it said.  “Hon Hai will stabilize in the second quarter,” Foxconn said in a statement, adding that all of its main factories in China have now resumed normal operations.  Net profit for January-March slumped 90% to T$2.1 billion ($70.3 million) from a year earlier - the lowest level since the first quarter of 2000 and well short of a Refinitiv consensus estimate of T$8.88 billion. Revenue declined 12%. For the second-quarter, the company expects revenue will show double-digit percentage growth from January-March although it will still likely mark a single-digit decline from the same period a year earlier. “Telecommuting, online entertainment and new lifestyles have brought us new growth momentum,” Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way told an investor teleconference. He added that its enterprise and computing units are expected to see a yearly revenue growth of more than 10% and more than 15% respectively in the current quarter. The exception is its consumer electronics division, much of which is smartphones. The division is forecast to post a 15% yearly decline in sales as the virus is set to have “an enormous” impact on demand. In the first quarter, the division accounted for 42% of revenue. “For consumer electronic products, because everyone is staying at home, naturally it affects consumers’ purchasing power and such power might take a very long time to recover,” he said. Highlighting that weak demand, first-quarter smartphone shipments in China tumbled 20%, its largest decline ever, data from market researcher IDC showed this month. Taiwan-based research firm TrendForce said last month it expects global smartphone production to slump a record 16.5% to 287 million phones in the June quarter from a year earlier as the coronavirus muzzles demand. Liu declined to given an earnings outlook for the second half or the full year, saying the pandemic had made forecasting too uncertain. Foxconn shares closed 1.4% lower ahead of the results on Friday, versus a 0.3% gain for the broader market .TWII. They have lost 15% for the year to date.

Capping a low-volume, late-summer week marked by tariff-related volatility, all three major U.S. indexes posted net gains for the period. The indexes were also up for the month of August, with the Nasdaq posting its largest monthly gain since January. Talks between Canada the United States to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) ended on a sour note as the two sides were unable to reach a deal, according to the Wall Street Journal.  In recent days trade jitters abated as Mexico and the United States reached a bilateral deal, but re-emerged later in the week following a report that U.S. President Donald Trump is prepared to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion of Chinese imports as soon as next week. “We may not have a replacement for NAFTA as quickly as we thought,” said John Toohey, head of equities at USAA in San Antonio. “That initial optimism that existed at the beginning of the week, that good news scenario is off the table.”  Amazon.com’s shares (AMZN.O) continued to inch upward, rising 0.5 percent as investors watch the company close in on its $1 trillion market share milestone. Apple Inc AAPL. closed up 1.2 percent, reaching a new closing high for the fifth straight session.

Chipotle Mexican Grill CNG.N shares extended their loss, dipping 1.8 percent after William Ackman’s Pershing Square cut its stake in the burrito chain.

"November 9, 2017",nvda,"                Chipmaker Nvidia tops estimates on gaming, data center boost - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Technology NewsNovember 9, 2017 /  9:27 PM / 3 years agoChipmaker Nvidia tops estimates on gaming, data center boostLaharee Chatterjee4 Min Read(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp’s (NVDA.O) quarterly profit and revenue topped market estimates and the chipmaker also gave a strong revenue forecast for the current quarter, powered by demand for its graphics chips used in gaming and data centers. A NVIDIA logo is shown at SIGGRAPH 2017 in Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 31, 2017.  REUTERS/Mike Blake - RC1C8FF654B0The company’s shares were up 2.5 percent in extended trading on Thursday. Their roughly 92-percent surge this year has made them the third-best performing stock on the Philadelphia Semiconductor index .SOX. The strength in Nvidia’s data center in the third quarter comes after a disappointing showing in the previous quarter and on the heels of rival Intel Corp (INTC.O) showcasing its strength in the same market two weeks back. Nvidia gets the bulk of its revenue from gaming, for which it is best known. But its growth hinges on new areas, especially its data center business, where its customers include Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) Azure. Revenue from the business, Nvidia’s second-biggest revenue contributor, more than doubled to $501 million in the quarter and easily beat analysts’ estimate of $474.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We’ve been steadfast with the excitement of accelerated computing for data centers. And I think this is just the beginning of it all,” Chief Executive Jensen Huang said on an analyst call. Nvidia’s gaming revenue increased 25.5 percent to $1.56 billion, accounting for nearly 60 percent of total revenue. That also beat analysts average estimate of $1.31 billion. “Gaming is one of the fastest-growing entertainment industries and we’re well-positioned for the holidays,” Huang said. Huang also played down a recent announcement by bitter rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) and Intel to partner to take on Nvidia in graphic chips for PCs. AUTOMOTIVE NOT YET RELEVANT Nvidia has also expanded its reach in automobiles, from making chips for infotainment systems, to unveiling its first chip for self-driving cars in October. Another source of demand has been from increasing interest in cryptocurrency mining. But Huang sought to temper expectations of a drive from that demand, echoing his own remarks and those from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O) two weeks back. “The longer-term way to think about that is crypto is small for us but not zero. And I believe that crypto will be around for sometime, kind of like today,” Huang said. Revenue from Nvidia’s automotive business rose 13.3 percent to $144 million, falling shy of estimates of $149.8 million. But analysts were not worried. “While automotive is an important long-term growth driver for NVDA, investors’ near-term focus is on the growth metrics of gaming and data center end-markets,” Loop Capital Markets analyst Betsy Van Hees said in an e-mail. Nvidia’s total revenue rose 31.5 percent to $2.64 billion, and profit surged 54.6 percent to $838 million, or $1.33 per share, in the quarter ended Oct. 29. Analysts’ on average were expecting a profit of 94 cents per share on revenue of $2.36 billion. The company forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $2.65 billion, plus or minus 2 percent, which translates to a range of $2.60 billion to $2.70 billion. Analysts were expecting $2.44 billion.

"September 18, 2017",nvda,"                Nvidia hits another record high as AI takes centerstage - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Technology NewsSeptember 18, 2017 /  3:37 PM / 3 years agoNvidia hits another record high as AI takes centerstageAishwarya Venugopal, Arjun Panchadar3 Min Read(Reuters) - Shares of Nvidia Corp touched a record high for the second straight day on Monday following yet another steep increase in the chipmaker’s price target by a Wall Street analyst. The logo of technology company Nvidia is seen at its headquarters in Santa Clara, California February 11, 2015. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith  Nvidia’s shares, valued at a low $23.3 in 2015, have since surged to hit a high of $190.10 on Monday, with at least four brokerages setting their price targets at $200 or above. Analysts have focused on the company’s progress in artificial intelligence, in particular. “Our sense is management believes that investors still severely underestimates the impact of AI and the size of the potential market,” Evercore analyst C J Muse wrote in a note on Friday after hosting Nvidia’s management. Nvidia has been rapidly expanding into newer technologies including artificial intelligence, cloud computing and self-driving cars, away from designing graphics-processing chips for which the company was known for. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Vivek Arya listed Nvidia a “top pick”, basing his view “on (Nvidia’s) underappreciated transformation from a traditional PC graphics vendor, into a supplier into high-end gaming, enterprise graphics, cloud, accelerated computing and automotive markets,” according to Seeking Alpha. Arya raised his price target on Monday by $25 to $210, the second highest on the Street. Evercore ISI’s whopping $70 price target raise on Friday to $250 is currently the highest. Wall Street is bullish on the stock, with 22 of 38 brokerages having a “buy” recommendation, as per Thomson Reuters data. Twelve have “hold” and 4 have “sell” rating. Broadening its push into AI, Nvidia has been partnering with auto makers to help develop self-driving vehicles.  In May, Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota Motor Corp through which the Japanese car maker would use Nvidia's AI technology to develop self-driving vehicle systems planned for the next few years. reut.rs/2wB8Qst “NVDA has created an industry standard for AI systems that will be nearly impossible to replicate,” Evercore’s Muse wrote in a note on Friday. Nvidia is also gaining from rising demand for its chips used to process cryptocurrency transactions. However, the company has little room for any missteps. Nvidia’s shares fell last month after the company’s second-quarter revenue in its data center and automotive businesses missed estimates.

"September 18, 2019",tsla,"                Tesla takes on Porsche with battle on Germany's toughest circuit - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Technology NewsSeptember 18, 2019 /  7:20 PM / 10 months agoTesla takes on Porsche with battle on Germany's toughest circuitEdward Taylor5 Min ReadFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Tesla TSLA wants to steal Porsche’s bragging rights by testing its Model S on the northern loop of Germany’s Nuerburgring circuit, using a marketing tool that German carmakers have long used to tout the superiority of their products.  Tesla electric cars are seen in the dealer's showroom in Oslo, Norway March 28, 2019. Picture taken March 28, 2019. REUTERS/Lefteris KaragiannopoulosGermany’s Auto Motor und Sport this week published photographs of a Tesla with “100D+” markings on the track where according to the magazine, it clocked an unofficial time of 7 minutes and 23 seconds, beating the recently launched electric Porsche Taycan’s lap time of 7 minutes 42 seconds. A formally timed record attempt was due to take place on Wednesday, with another attempt scheduled for Saturday, Auto Motor und Sport said. Tesla is using the Nordschleife, as the track is known, to market its “Plaid” mode on a 7-seater Tesla Model S, CEO Elon Musk confirmed on Twitter.  “We expect these track times to be beaten by the actual production 7 seat Model S Plaid variant that goes into production around Oct/Nov next year,” Musk said on Tuesday.  Setting a new record time for four-door electric cars would give the U.S.-based manufacturer’s ageing Model S a new lease of life just as Audi, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Porsche prepare to launch electric cars. The Nordschleife is one of the world’s most treacherous thanks to its length of just over 20 km (12.5 miles), slanted cambers and an altitude difference of 300 meters (yards) between its highest and lowest point.  Porsche says its 919 Evo hybrid racecar currently holds the record with a lap time of 5 minutes 19 seconds, set in 2018 by keeping up an average speed of 234 km (146.3 miles) an hour, despite blind corners, narrow bends and limited safety run-off zones. Porsche, BMW, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Cadillac and Aston Martin have used the racetrack as a boot camp to hone reliability and handling and to benchmark their vehicles against top competitors. “If you take the same corner, on the same road, at the same speed, in two different cars, you can see how your car measures up to the competition,” said driver Dirk Schoysman, who set a Nordschleife lap record in 1996 in a Nissan Skyline with a time of 7 minutes 59 seconds. For Nissan, the new record underscored the Skyline R33 GT-R’s global status as a serious sportscar, proving that Japanese brands could be as competitive as vehicles made by Germany’s finest manufacturers. The circuit opened in June 1927 to become an important battleground where legendary drivers like Tazio Nuvolari and Juan Manuel Fangio drove some of their most memorable races. In 1935 senior Nazi officials gathered at the German Grand Prix ready to cheer the home team, only to see Italy’s Nuvolari beat the Mercedes-Benz W25 and the Auto Union Typ B in an Alfa Romeo Tipo B P3. The track remained a venue for Grand Prix races until 1976 when a horrendous crash almost killed driving ace Niki Lauda, leading to the opening of a shorter, wider Nuerburgring track with improved facilities in May 1984. But carmakers have continued to use the older circuit’s 40 right-hand and 33 left-hand turns through the Eifel region’s forested hills to develop their regular vehicles.  “Cars cannot keep secrets here, mistakes and problems will eventually rise to the surface,” Schoysman said. At the Hatzenbach corner, cars enter a dip forcing them over a series of undulations with their suspension compressed, testing the chassis to the limit.  “If the car changes its line in that corner it may be a tire flexing, the suspension bushes that have gone through their stroke, or a problem with the stiffness of the car body, or its electronic stability program,” Schoysman explained. Slideshow (4 Images)These development tweaks continue to be relevant for electric cars as well as for marketing purposes.

"January 3, 2020",tsla,"                Musk defies skeptics, meets Tesla delivery goal; shares hit record - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Technology NewsJanuary 3, 2020 /  1:25 PM / 7 months agoMusk defies skeptics, meets Tesla delivery goal; shares hit recordMunsif Vengattil, Tina Bellon4 Min Read(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) beat Wall Street estimates for annual vehicle deliveries and met the low-end of its own target, sending shares to a record high in a vindication for Chief Executive Elon Musk after a few turbulent years.  Boosted by demand for its mass-produced Model 3 sedans as overseas sales pick up, Tesla on Friday said it delivered 112,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, including 92,550 Model 3s and 19,450 Model S/X SUVs, which was above expectations of 104,960 vehicles, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The Silicon Valley carmaker delivered approximately 367,500 vehicles during all of 2019, just meeting the low end of its target to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles in 2019. Tesla shares were up as much as 5.5% at $454, touching a record high.  The stock has had a strong run in recent months after posting a rare profit in the latest quarter and news of China ramp up. With a market valuation of more than $80 billion, Tesla is far outstripping those of traditional carmakers General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N). (Graphic: Tesla 2019 share movement click, here)   Related CoverageTesla rally leaves short sellers down $3 billion since 2018The delivery results defy skeptics of Musk, whose mercurial behavior over the last two years came under close scrutiny from federal regulators and shareholders of Tesla. Musk, who has more than 30 million Twitter followers, has a history of firing off tweets that resulted in an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a defamation trial against him. The Tesla CEO settled the SEC complaint for $20 million in 2018 and a Los Angeles jury cleared Musk in the defamation case in December.   “Elon has Tesla executing right on track,” said Roth Capital Partners analyst Craig Irwin.      CHINA RAMP-UP FILE PHOTO: China-made Tesla Model 3 vehicles are seen at the Shanghai Gigafactory of the U.S. electric car maker in Shanghai, China December 30, 2019.  REUTERS/Yilei Sun Tesla also provided an update on its Shanghai factory, which has started churning out Model 3 cars. It said the plant demonstrated a production run-rate capability of more than 3,000 units per week.  The run-rate shows that the factory appears to be ramping faster than expected, Baird Equity Research analyst Ben Kallo said. “Shanghai deliveries should be the next catalyst to drive volume growth.” The $2-billion factory, Tesla’s first car manufacturing site outside the United States, is the centerpiece of its ambitions to boost sales in the world’s biggest auto market and avoid higher import tariffs imposed on U.S.-made cars. A company representative on Thursday said that Tesla will deliver its first China-made Model 3 sedans to the public on Jan. 7.  The Model 3 is Tesla’s most affordable car, with lower-range versions available starting at $35,000. Analysts in the past have questioned how rapidly Tesla’s vehicle sales will grow as government subsidies for electric vehicle purchases dwindle in the United States, China and other markets. Some analysts consider those subsidies the biggest driver for Tesla purchases. Traditional automakers largely relying on fuel-powered vehicles on Friday reported a decline in fourth-quarter U.S. sales and saw their shares tumble as a widening conflict with Iran pushed oil prices more than $2 a barrel on Friday. Slideshow (6 Images)Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) on Friday said it saw a 2% fall in U.S. auto sales, while GM reported its fourth-quarter U.S. deliveries were down more than 6%. “The recently escalating geopolitical uncertainties driving oil prices higher are likely to create a tailwind for TSLA shares,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Jed Dorsheimer said.

FILE PHOTO: A Tesla sign is seen on the Shanghai Gigafactory of the U.S. electric car maker before a delivery ceremony in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020. REUTERS/Aly Song/File PhotoWith Tesla still up more than 25% since the company posted its second consecutive quarterly profit a week ago, Canaccord Genuity cut its rating on Tesla to “hold” from “buy,” further shrinking the already small number of analysts who recommend buying the stock.  Tesla Vice President Tao Lin said on the Weibo social media platform that car deliveries from its new Shanghai plant would be temporarily delayed and that the company planned to restart production on Feb. 10. The $2 billion factory is a key part of Chief Executive Elon Musk’s plan to make more than half a million automobiles this year.  Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill, who recommends selling Tesla, warned in a report that Tesla’s stock is trading at extreme price-to-earnings multiples compared to many leading technology companies. Even after Wednesday’s drop, Tesla is trading at about 55 times expected 2021 net income, compared to Amazon (AMZN.O) at 49, Apple (AAPL.O) at 22 and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) at 23, according to Refinitiv data. “We’ve never seen a stock rise that much that fast with such little regard to past fundamentals or track record,” Gill wrote.  Tesla last week said it expected a delay of up to a week and a half in the ramp-up of Model 3 production at the Shanghai plant after the Chinese government ordered it to shut the factory due to the outbreak. The coronavirus outbreak has disrupted business across China, with the government there saying that the death toll had reached 490 as of Tuesday, up 65 from the previous day. “Given the 3,000 per week China Model 3 production expectations in a country that remains on lockdown, we feel a reset of expectations in Q1 is likely and thus needs to be reflected in the valuation,” Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a report, leaving his price target unchanged at $750 per share. The stock was last down 17% at about $738. Wednesday’s drop followed a sudden selloff in the final minutes of a rally on Tuesday that still left the stock up almost 14% in that session.  Tesla’s rally of over 300% since early June has been a vindication for Musk, who has transformed a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories.  Still, many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth in the face of competition from established rivals including BMW (BMWG.DE) and Volkswagen (VOWG.DE). Even many Tesla bulls question the stock’s valuation following its recent, electrifying surge.  Barclays analyst Brian Johnson maintained his “underweight” rating on Tesla while raising his price target to $300 from $200.  FILE PHOTO: Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk speaks next to a screen showing an image of Tesla Model 3 car during an opening ceremony for Tesla China-made Model Y program in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo“We continue to believe TSLA is fundamentally overvalued – but nevertheless concede that the recent price action opens up the possibility of raising capital cheaply, and hence reduces that chance of a stalled business,” Johnson wrote in a client note. Following Canaccord’s downgrade, nine analysts recommend buying Tesla’s stock, while 11 analysts are neutral and 15 analysts recommend selling, according to Refinitiv. The median price target of analysts is $390.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo(Reuters) - David Einhorn, president of Greenlight Capital, at the Sohn Investment Conference on Monday said his firm is positive on airplane leasing company AerCap Holdings and negative on railcar leasing company GATX Corp. Einhorn said GATX has “trouble returning to pre-crisis usage levels,” while AerCorp shares are trading at half the book value and less than half the price-to-earnings of GATX’s shares.  Speaking favorably of both industries, he said the airline sector has some advantages over rail that make AerCap the better choice over GATX, whose shares he believes are overvalued. “Neither has consumer-facing businesses, and both have terrible news. AerCap operates in a growing industry with a favorable outlook,” Einhorn said. “We think the market has it wrong.” AerCap shares are up 31% in 2019, while GATX has gained 11% year-to-date. AerCap is the industry leader with 11% marketshare, he noted. As aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing have backlogs of multiple years, aircraft leasing companies step in to fill the gap as air travel continues to increase around the globe. Einhorn, who told the Sohn Investment Conference that the theme of his pitch involved Trains, Planes and Automobiles, referencing a 1987 movie, reassured the audience that he still did not like Tesla Inc. Einhorn started out with a slide show of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s statements about his electric car company and concluded by saying that’s “a lot of horseshit.” Einhorn has been short Tesla. In a letter to clients last month, Einhorn’s Greenlight renewed criticism of Musk and Tesla, saying the electric car company appeared to be “on the brink” of failure again.  The letter cited a lack of demand, “desperate” price cuts, layoffs, “closing-and-then-not-closing” stores, closing service centers, slashing capital expenditures, rushed product announcements and “a new effort to distract investors from the demand problem with hyperbole over TSLA’s autonomous driving capabilities.” Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Einhorn’s remark.

FILE PHOTO: People visit a Tesla booth during the media day for the Shanghai auto show in Shanghai, China April 16, 2019. REUTERS/Aly Song/File PhotoTesla’s stock fell 3.8% to $203.03, bringing its loss to 11% since the National Transportation Safety Board said on Thursday that the Autopilot system was engaged during a fatal collision of a Model 3 on March 1, in at least the third deadly U.S. crash reported involving the driver-assistance system.  Investors were also spooked after Musk told employees on Thursday he would increase cost-cutting and that $2.7 billion in recently raised capital would give Tesla just 10 months to break even at the rate it burned cash in the first quarter. Earlier in the session, Tesla sank below $200 for the first time since December 2016. “We believe that the NTSB report could cast doubt on TSLA’s self-driving capabilities, which have been highly touted by Mr. Musk,” Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill wrote in a client note on Monday. Tesla’s shares have fallen 18% since the company sold a $1.84 billion convertible bond and almost $900 million of stock on May 2 to raise fresh capital as the automaker continues to lose money. The buyers of the stock in that offer, including institutional investors and Musk, are now down over $150 million on their investment. Adding pressure on Tesla’s stock, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives on Sunday cut his price target to $230 from $275, while maintaining his neutral rating. Ives wrote in a client note that he had “major concerns” about Tesla’s growth prospects and path toward profitability. Tesla’s $1.84 billion convertible bond due in 2024 was priced at 92.8 cents on the dollar, a low since it was issued earlier this month. Its $977.5 million 2022 convertible bond was also at an all-time low, trading at 96.46 cents on the dollar, down from 125.68 cents in January. Its $1.8 billion junk bond was trading at a five-month low of 84.25 cents on the dollar. The NTSB’s preliminary report on the crash in Delray Beach, Florida, has renewed doubts about the safety of Tesla’s driver assistance technology and its ability to make its cars fully autonomous. On April 22, Musk told investors that driverless Tesla “robotaxis” would be available in some U.S. markets next year, a claim met by skepticism by some self-driving experts. Musk is battling to convince investors that demand for the Model 3, the sedan targeted to propel Tesla to sustainable profit, remains high, and that it can be delivered efficiently and swiftly to customers around the world. Tesla lost $702 million in the first quarter and warned that profit would be delayed until the latter half of the year. With Tesla’s stock down 39% year to date, 10 analysts recommend buying the shares, while another nine are neutral and 12 recommend selling, according to Refinitiv. The analysts’ median price target is $250, down from $300 a month ago. After Tesla’s stock market value surged past those of General Motors and Ford Motor in 2017 amid optimism about the Model 3, it fell below GM in January and last week fell below Ford. Tesla’s market capitalization is now about $36 billion.

"July 3, 2019",tsla,"                Tesla shares jump as record deliveries ease demand concerns - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Market NewsJuly 3, 2019 /  12:57 PM / a year agoTesla shares jump as record deliveries ease demand concernsVibhuti Sharma3 Min ReadJuly 3 (Reuters) - Shares of Tesla Inc jumped 8% on Wednesday after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk made good on his promise of delivering record number of electric cars in the second quarter, quelling fears about demand for its sedans and SUVs. Wall Street analysts and investors have raised doubts about demand and the Silicon Valley automaker’s ability to sort out recent delivery issues, particularly after a disastrous first quarter when deliveries slumped 31%. “We are increasingly comfortable that they should reflect an even better in the third quarter, and probably their first hundred thousand in a quarter,” Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. Tesla delivered a record number of 95,200 vehicles in the second quarter, beating analysts’ average estimates, but did not comment on when it would return to a profit. Shares of Tesla were set to open at their highest in two months. Up to Tuesday close, the stock had lost nearly one-third of its value so far this year. Tesla’s first quarter was hurt by logistics issues at its international ports and a drop-off in U.S. orders after a tax credit was halved, which spurred concerns that Tesla may have tapped a limited market for electric cars at premium prices. While Musk has been trying to convince investors that demand remains high for Tesla cars and delivery could be made efficiently, some analysts remained skeptical about Tesla’s ability to deliver on its promise. The CEO has repeatedly said Tesla could deliver a record number of cars in the second quarter, beating the 90,700 it sent to customers in the final quarter of last year. In the quarter, Tesla delivered 77,550 Model 3s - seen as linchpin for its growth into a mass-market company. That compared with analysts’ average estimate of 73,144, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “These are undeniably strong numbers, but given Tesla’s recent history of significant swings in performance from quarter-to-quarter we remain cautious for now,” Nicholas Hyett, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said. Tesla still faces multiple challenges, including starting production in China in the backdrop of U.S.-China trade tensions and overhauling its production process at a time several of its top executives are leaving the company. “We think bears will argue results are a flash in the plan, though we believe deliveries are sustainable and note the release does mention TSLA is well positioned to continue growing total production and deliveries in Q3,” Baird analysts said.

REUTERS/Rick WilkingNEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Amazon.com still dominates the fast-growing e-commerce pie, but it’s getting some company. Lockdowns have trained people to shop online including in formerly laggard categories like groceries. That has helped Jeff Bezos but even more so digital sales at Walmart and other retailers. The future may be a lot to do with balancing clicks and bricks. Overall retail sales have suffered mightily as shops shuttered their doors to keep coronavirus at bay. Evercore ISI estimates sector sales, excluding e-commerce, autos and gas, will shrink 6% this year after expanding nearly 2% in 2019. A recession, which the United States officially entered in February, is an additional headwind for consumer spending. But the pandemic has acted as an accelerant for e-commerce. Shoppers had little choice but to order online to get milk, eggs and the like delivered to their doorsteps. In April alone internet sales doubled or more year-over-year at Walmart, Target, Home Depot and Etsy, reckons Morgan Stanley, as consumers stocked up on food, cleaning products and stuff for home improvement. The convenience has staying power even as people emerge from sheltering in place. Morgan Stanley revised its forecast for online sales growth this year to 25%, nearly doubling its previous estimate. That’s an additional $71 billion directed at electronic purchases. And there’s plenty of headroom. E-commerce is expected to account for about a quarter of the estimated $3 trillion in total retail sales this year excluding food services, among other categories. Amazon is forecast to grab 38% of e-commerce sales this year according to eMarketer. But a rising tide will lift other boats as well. The research outfit expects Walmart to beat internet-only marketplace eBay to the No. 2 spot this year. Beleaguered traditional retailers have a potential advantage on the e-commerce front, too. Even before the pandemic, more consumers said they wanted both online and in-person options, while fewer wanted to be limited to either walk-in stores or online-only shopping, according to an Evercore ISI survey. Curbside pickup, a staple of post-lockdown reopening, could be here to stay. That’s a piece of the logistics puzzle Amazon mostly still lacks.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

Dickerson was named CEO of Blue Apron just months after it went public in June 2017.  However, the company’s shares are down nearly 90 percent since its IPO as the meal-kit service provider has struggled to boost sagging sales and turn a profit.  Kozlowski, who was previously chief operating officer of Etsy, takes over the helm at a time when the company is battling intense competition from rivals, including HelloFresh SE, as well as grocers selling ready-to-eat meals.  Blue Apron also said co-founder and Chief Technology Officer Ilia Papas would be leaving the company to pursue other opportunity.

The S&P 500 and the Dow were slightly higher and the Nasdaq nominally lower, their losses held in check by a rise in tech stocks. Markets have been whipsawed in recent days as conflicting reports on whether the world’s two largest economies would be able to arrive at a “phase one” agreement prior to Dec. 15, when a new round of tariffs on Chinese imports is scheduled to take effect. “We’re on hold until we see what happens on the trade front,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. “People are trying to get a read on what’s going to happen with the trade talks and the next relevant deadline is Dec 15.” Market participants appeared to show little heed to the drama unfolding in Washington as the U.S. House of Representatives prepared to draft articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. “What impacts investor psychology is uncertainty, and I don’t think there’s any uncertainty as to how (the impeachment proceedings) will play out,” Carlson added. “At the end of the day, whether there’s an impeachment or not isn’t going to stop a money manager from deciding whether or not he’ll by Intel.” The articles of impeachment stem from a July 25 phone call in which Trump asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to carry out two investigations that would benefit him politically. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 17.89 points, or 0.06%, to 27,667.67, the S&P 500 gained 2.02 points, or 0.06%, to 3,114.78 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.35 points, or -0%, to 8,566.32. Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 seven were trading in the red. Materials stocks were the biggest winners, while consumer staples suffered the largest percentage drop. Nike Inc gained 1.8% following Goldman Sachs’ upgrade of the sportswear maker’s stock to “buy” from “neutral.” Kroger Co shares fell 3.5% after the supermarket chain missed Wall Street earnings estimates, hurt by stiff competition from Walmart Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Online craft retailer Etsy dipped 2.7% on the heels of a downgrade to “underweight” by Morgan Stanley. SecureWorks Corp jumped 22.8%, on course for its best day ever, after the cyber security firm posted a surprise third-quarter profit. Sage Therapeutics Inc tumbled 59.1% after its depression drug failed in a late-stage study. On the economic front, a shrinking trade deficit, a drop in jobless claims and a rebound in factory orders suggested a still-robust, if slowing, U.S. economy. Investors now look to Friday’s employment report from the U.S. Labor Department, which is expected to show an increase of 180,000 nonfarm payrolls in November. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 46 new highs and 53 new lows.

Tech stocks led all three major U.S. stock averages marginally into the black following upbeat statements from President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that the U.S.-China trade negotiations are “on track” and “going well.” Markets have been whipsawed in recent days by conflicting reports on whether the world’s two largest economies would be able to arrive at a “phase one” agreement prior to Dec. 15, when a new round of tariffs on Chinese imports is expected to take effect. “Investors are trying to calibrate things,” said Matthew Keator, managing partner in the Keator Group, a wealth management firm in Lenox, Massachusetts. “The markets are going to toggle up and down until we see what happens on Dec. 15th to get some sort of clarity in terms of how to move forward in the near term.” Market participants appeared to shrug off the drama unfolding in Washington as the U.S. House of Representatives prepared to draft articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. “The market has become desensitized a bit to the partisanship that’s been going on,” said Keator, while adding that “uncertainty is not something the market enjoys.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 28.01 points, or 0.1%, to 27,677.79, the S&P 500 gained 4.67 points, or 0.15%, to 3,117.43 and the Nasdaq Composite added 4.03 points, or 0.05%, to 8,570.70. Of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, eight closed higher. Materials stocks were the biggest winners, while energy suffered the largest percentage drop. Nike Inc gained 2.2% following Goldman Sachs’ upgrade of the sportswear maker’s stock to “buy” from “neutral.” Kroger Co shares fell 3.0% after the supermarket chain missed Wall Street earnings estimates, hurt by stiff competition from Walmart Inc and Amazon.com Inc . Online craft retailer Etsy dipped 2.5% on a downgrade to “underweight” by Morgan Stanley. SecureWorks Corp jumped 29.4%, its best day ever, after the cyber security firm posted a surprise third-quarter profit.

Investors now look to Friday’s employment report from the U.S. Labor Department, which is expected to show nonfarm payrolls increased by 180,000 in November. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.15-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.00-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 54 new highs and 64 new lows. Volume on U.S. exchanges was 6.42 billion shares, compared with the 6.71 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidNEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) has teamed up with Mastercard Inc (MA.N), United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) and Etsy Inc (ETSY.O) among other organizations, to build and test tools to help individuals start saving for emergencies. The companies will work with a group of nonprofits focused on consumer financial health to build then test savings products on their employees, BlackRock said in a statement. The program will be funded by BlackRock’s previously announced $50 million commitment to its emergency savings initiative, the asset manager said. A number of companies have in recent years taken steps to encourage employees to fund emergency accounts as they respond to data that suggests a large percentage of American households are ill-prepared to deal with a financial emergency. A recent Federal Reserve report on the economic wellbeing of American households found that about 40% of Americans would struggle to cover an unexpected $400 expense.

"May 5, 2020",amd,"                Lenovo launches new server platform with AMD data center chips - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Technology NewsMay 5, 2020 /  12:05 PM / 3 months agoLenovo launches new server platform with AMD data center chips1 Min Read(Reuters) - Lenovo Group said on Tuesday it has launched a new server platform capable of handling heavy computing tasks inside data centers using chips from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Demand from cloud computing companies have boosted sales of server chips, helping the overall results of AMD and rival Intel Corp. Lenovo, the world’s biggest maker of personal computers, is also a major maker of servers that sit inside data centers and power online services such as gaming and video streaming.  Intel’s Xeon chips have dominated the market for server chips, but AMD has been gaining ground since its re-entry into the business three years ago with rival EPYC processors that earned positive reviews. Lenovo said on Tuesday that the newest server design would accommodate two AMD processor chips inside a single server, making the machines capable of handling more workload. Previously, Lenovo had only offered servers with one AMD chip.

Mai (Reuters) - Es folgt der Reuters-Blick zu wichtigen Entwicklungen in der Unternehmenswelt über die Top-Themen des Tages hinaus: NOVARTIS - Zürich: Der Schweizer Pharmakonzern wird den Wirkstoff seines neuen Augenmedikaments Beovu künftig in Österreich herstellen. Das Werk im tirolerischen Kundl wird für 30 Millionen Dollar ausgebaut und soll die Wirksubstanz ab kommenden Jahr dann exklusiv bereitstellen. Derzeit wird auch noch in der Schweiz produziert. Novartis traut Beovu, das gegen die Augenerkrankung AMD eingesetzt wird, Milliardenumsätze zu. Das Mittel muss allerdings gegen bereits gut etablierte Medikamente wie Eylea von Bayer und Regeneron und das von Novartis gemeinsam mit Roche vertriebene Lucentis bestehen. SIXT LEASING - Düsseldorf: Die Hyundai Capital Bank Europe hält nach Ablauf der zweiten Annahmefrist rund 92 Prozent an der bisherigen Leasing-Tochter des Autovermieters Sixt. Bei einer Mindestannahmeschwelle von 55 Prozent hatten die Aktionäre zum Ende der regulären Annahmefrist lediglich 72,84 Prozent zum Kauf angedient. “Wir sind optimistisch, dass die noch ausstehenden Angebotsbedingungen in den nächsten Monaten erfüllt werden, und erwarten den Abschluss der Transaktion in der zweiten Jahreshälfte 2020”, erklärte der Finanzvorstand von Sixt Leasing, Björn Waldow. AUSTRIAN AIRLINES - Wien: Österreich pocht im Gegenzug für Staatshilfen für die strauchelnde Lufthansa-Tochter Austrian Airlines (AUA) auf eine Absicherung des Langstrecken-Drehkreuz in Wien. Vom Management der Lufthansa erwarte man sich Vorschläge, “die hier auch die Situation betrachten, dass Wien genauso wichtig ist wie München oder Frankfurt”, sagte Wirtschaftsministerin Margarete Schramböck. Zudem müsse die AUA Flugzeuge haben, die diese Strecken auch abdecken können. “Die jetzigen Flieger sind in die Jahre gekommen”, sagte die Ministerin. Drängen lassen will sich die Regierung aber nicht. “Hier rasch zu handeln und Geschwindigkeit vor Qualität gehen zu lassen, das ist nicht unser Ziel”, sagte Schramböck. AXA - Paris: Der Versicherungskonzern will nach dem jüngsten Gerichtsurteil den Großteil der Ansprüche einiger Restaurantbesitzer begleichen. AXA teilte mit, weitere 500 Millionen Euro zur Kompensation von Ansprüchen kleinerer Unternehmen bereitstellen zu wollen. Vorstandschef Thomas Buberl kündigte an, AXA plane, die Verluste von Betriebsunterbrechungen wegen der Virus-Krise für die Mehrheit der Restaurantbesitzer auszugleichen, die dem vor Gericht verhandelten Fall ähnelten. “Diese Verträge machen weniger als zehn Prozent aller Verträge mit Restaurantbesitzern aus, und ich bin zuversichtlich, dass wir eine Lösung finden werden”, so Buberl. Im Streit um Betriebsschließungs-Versicherungen für Hotels und Gaststätten in der Corona-Krise hatte der französische Branchenriese vergangene Woche eine Niederlage einstecken müssen. DAIMLER - Frankfurt: Die Lkw-Tochter Daimler Truck und der Motorenhersteller Rolls-Royce Power Systems planen eine Kooperation zu Entwicklung und Vertrieb von stationären Notstromversorgungssystemen mit Brennstoffzellentechnik. Diese sollen emissionsfreie Alternativen zu Dieselmotoren bieten, die bislang als Notstromaggregate oder zur Abdeckung von Spitzenlasten eingesetzt werden. Bis Ende des Jahres soll ein erstes Demonstrationsgerät in Friedrichshafen in Betrieb gehen und der Kooperationsvertrag unterzeichnet werden. Daimler gründet mit dem Lkw-Hersteller Volvo ein Joint Venture, um den noch relativ teuren Brennstoffzellenantrieb auch bei Nutzfahrzeugen zum Einsatz zu bringen. SAMSUNG GROUP - Seoul: Der juristische Ärger für den Erben des südkoreanischen Firmenkonglomerats und Vize-Verwaltungsratschefs des Elektronikkonzerns Samsung Electronics, Jay Y. Lee, nimmt zu. Am Dienstag wurde der 51-Jährige, der 2018 bereits ein Jahr wegen Bestechung im Gefängnis saß, von der Staatsanwaltschaft wegen einer umstrittenen Fusion sowie mutmaßlichen Buchhaltungsbetrugs vernommen. Im Mittelpunkt der Ermittlungen stehen die Biotechfirma Samsung Biologics wie auch der Baukonzern Samsung C&T, dessen größter Aktionär Lee ist. Ähnlich wie bei dem Bestechungsskandal, in den auch die frühere Präsidentin Park Geun Hye verwickelt war und der von der Justiz derzeit neu aufgerollt wird, geht es um Maßnahmen Lees, die seine Nachfolge absichern sollten. LATAM AIRLINES - Bangalore: Die chilenische Fluggesellschaft ist wegen der Reisebeschränkungen zur Eindämmung der Corona-Pandemie in Schieflage geraten. Lateinamerikas größte Airline und seine Töchter in Chile, Peru, Kolumbien, Ecuador und den USA haben Insolvenzschutz nach Kapitel 11 angemeldet, wie Latam mitteilte. Die Gesellschaften in Argentinien, Brasilien und Paraguay seien nicht betroffen. “Wir haben eine Reihe schwieriger Maßnahmen ergriffen, um die Auswirkungen dieser beispiellosen Branchenkrise zu mildern. Letztendlich ist dieser Weg jedoch die beste Option”, erklärte Vorstandschef Roberto Alvo. Den Kassenbestand bezifferte das Unternehmen mit rund 1,3 Milliarden Dollar. Der Flugverkehr laufe derweil weiter, hieß es. SIMMO - Wien: Der Immobilienkonzern hat im ersten Quartal aufgrund von Corona-bedingten Liegenschaftsabwertungen rote Zahlen geschrieben. Unter dem Strich steht ein Verlust von 21,4 Millionen Euro nach einem Gewinn von 15,1 Millionen Euro im Vorjahreszeitraum, wie SImmo mitteilte. Die Abwertungen wurden mit 31,5 Millionen Euro beziffert, was rund 1,3 Prozent des Immobilienvermögens entspricht. Das operative Ergebnis aus Vermietungen (FFO I) stieg hingegen auf 13,8 Millionen Euro nach 10,8 Millionen Euro. Einen Ausblick wagte SImmo nicht. Für die kommenden Monate sei man gut gerüstet, erklärte der österreichische Konzern. Dank der zu Jahresbeginn erfolgten Kapitalerhöhung verfüge SImmo über eine stabile Eigen- und Liquiditätsbasis. FRAPORT - Düsseldorf: Der Frankfurter Flughafen hat auch in der vergangenen Woche beinahe stillgestanden. Das Passagieraufkommen sank im Vergleich zum Vorjahreszeitraum um 95,4 Prozent und die Flüge um 83 Prozent. Das Frachtaufkommen ging um 17,4 Prozent zurück. Reisebeschränkungen zur Eindämmung des Coronavirus hatten den Flugverkehr am Frankfurter Flughafen bereits im April zum Erliegen gebracht. Die Passagierzahlen brachen im Vergleich zum Vorjahresmonat um 96,9 Prozent auf 188.078 ein. FUJIFILM HOLDINGS- Tokio: Japans Regierung rückt einem Medienbericht zufolge zunächst von einer Zulassung des Medikaments Avigan des Herstellers Fujifilm für die Behandlung von Covid-19 ab. Wie die Nachrichtenagentur Kyodo News unter Berufung auf einen Regierungsbeamten berichtete, werde keine Zulassung des Grippemedikaments wie ursprünglich geplant bis Ende Mai erfolgen. Ministerpräsident Shinzo Abe sagte Anfang des Monats, er hoffe, dass das Medikament irgendwann im Mai zugelassen werde, wenn seine Wirksamkeit und Sicherheit bestätigt werden könne. Fujifilm-Aktien brachen in der vergangenen Woche ein, nachdem Kyodo berichtet hatte, dass eine Zwischenstudie keine eindeutigen Beweise für die Wirksamkeit von Avigan bei der Lungenerkrankung Covid-19 zeigte. Forscher der an der Fujita Health Universität durchgeführten Analyse sagten, dass die Zwischenstudie durchgeführt worden sei, um die wissenschaftliche Gültigkeit zu gewährleisten, nicht um die Wirksamkeit des Medikaments überprüfen. Das Unternehmen reagierte nicht sofort auf eine Anfrage der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters zur Stellungsnahme. Das Medikament ist derzeit Gegenstand von mindestens 16 klinischen Studien auf der ganzen Welt. Der Einsatz von Avigan ist umstritten, da es in Tierstudien nachweislich Geburtsfehler verursacht hat.

Mandatory Credit: Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports Washington Redskins rookie WR Antonio Gandy-Golden confirmed Wednesday he was diagnosed with the coronavirus and has recovered. “During my pre-draft training, I tested positive for COVID-19 on March 24,” he said in a statement issued through his agent. “My symptoms thankfully were mild, but I self-quarantined for two weeks and followed all guidelines from health experts. I was fully cleared April 7. I feel 100% now and can’t wait to get on the field for the Redskins ASAP!” Washington selected the Liberty product in the fourth round of the draft in April. In 2019, the 6-foot-4 receiver played in 13 games for the Flames, catching 79 passes for 1,396 yards and 10 touchdowns. His 17.7 yards per catch ranked in the top 10 among FBS receivers with 60 or more catches. Redskins defensive icon Dexter Manley, 62, is improving in his battle with the virus and could be released from the hospital soon, the team said Wednesday. —Field Level MediaOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS/Axel SchmidtExamples can be seen  here  and  here  .   The article makes spelling, grammar and factual errors, for example, calling  Virginia a country (  here  ). It also makes further secondary claims beyond the scope of this check.  The article includes video from a 2007 NBC special report predicting what technological advancements would be made in the next 10 years, visible  youtu.be/1YJsxMcAJoA  . Anchor Brian Williams can be heard saying: “Life in the U.S. in 10 years’ time. By that time, there may be all kinds of new ways to safeguard and identify all those things that make each of us unique. Our faces, even our fingerprints, even our eyes.”  Journalist Tom Costello continues the report on “the future of technology”. Microchips are mentioned as a possible future way to identify people in a hospital emergency. The report also discusses facial recognition technology and fingerprint scans to allow users to open doors and pay for groceries.  The images in the false post are, clockwise from the top-left, Williams during a newscast with a background image Reuters couldn’t identify (but not taken from the video in question), a 2002 Getty photograph of a microchip called VeriChip (  here  ), a photoshopped image of a man’s hand (  here  ), and a Reuters photograph of a contraceptive implant (  here  ).  The 2007 NBC report explored possible developments in biometric technology by 2017. At no time in the video does NBC state “all Americans will receive a Microchip implant” by 2017, or by 2020.

"June 26, 2020",FB,"                Facebook will label newsworthy posts that break rules as ad boycott widens - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsJune 26, 2020 /  4:59 PM / 25 days agoFacebook will label newsworthy posts that break rules as ad boycott widensElizabeth Culliford, Sheila Dang4 Min Read(Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Friday it will start labeling newsworthy content that violates the social media company’s policies, and label all posts and ads about voting with links to authoritative information, including those from politicians. A Facebook spokeswoman confirmed its new policy would have meant attaching a link on voting information to U.S. President Donald Trump’s post last month about mail-in ballots. Rival Twitter had affixed a fact-checking label to that post. Facebook has drawn heat from employees and lawmakers in recent weeks over its decisions not to act on inflammatory posts by the president. “There are no exceptions for politicians in any of the policies I’m announcing here today,” Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post. Zuckerberg also said Facebook would ban ads that claim people from groups based on race, religion, sexual orientation or immigration status are a threat to physical safety or health. The policy changes come during a growing ad boycott campaign, called “Stop Hate for Profit,” that was started by several U.S. civil rights groups after the death of George Floyd, to pressure the company to act on hate speech and misinformation. Zuckerberg’s address fell short, said Rashad Robinson, president of civil rights group Color Of Change, which is one of the groups behind the boycott campaign. FILE PHOTO: Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies at a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, U.S., October 23, 2019. REUTERS/Erin Scott/File Photo“What we’ve seen in today’s address from Mark Zuckerberg is a failure to wrestle with the harms FB has caused on our democracy & civil rights,” Robinson tweeted. “If this is the response he’s giving to major advertisers withdrawing millions of dollars from the company, we can’t trust his leadership.” Shares of Facebook closed down more than 8% and Twitter ended 7% lower on Friday after Unilever PLC said it would stop its U.S. ads on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter for the rest of the year, citing “divisiveness and hate speech during this polarized election period in the U.S.” More than 90 advertisers including Japanese carmaker Honda Motor Co Ltd’s U.S. subsidiary, Unilever’s Ben & Jerry’s, Verizon Communications Inc and The North Face, a unit of VF Corp, have joined the campaign, according to a list by ad activism group Sleeping Giants. Hours after Facebook's announcement, Coca-Cola Co said starting from July 1, it would pause paid advertising on all social media platforms globally for at least 30 days. bit.ly/3geAHpF One of Facebook’s top spenders, consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble Co, on Wednesday pledged to conduct a review of ad platforms and stop spending where it found hateful content. P&G declined to say if it had reached a decision on Facebook. The campaign specifically asks businesses not to advertise on Facebook’s platforms in July, though Twitter has also long been urged to clean up alleged abuses and misinformation on its platform. “We have developed policies and platform capabilities designed to protect and serve the public conversation, and as always, are committed to amplifying voices from under-represented communities and marginalized groups,” said Sarah Personette, vice president for Twitter’s Global Client Solutions. FILE PHOTO: The company logo for Unilever is displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., February 17, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid“We are respectful of our partners’ decisions and will continue to work and communicate closely with them during this time.” In a statement, a Facebook spokeswoman pointed to its civil rights audit and investments in Artificial Intelligence that allow it to find and take action on hate speech. “We know we have more work to do,” she said, noting that Facebook will continue working with civil rights groups, the Global Alliance for Responsible Media, and other experts to develop more tools, technology and policies to “continue this fight.” Reporting by Sheila Dang and Elizabeth Culliford; Additional reporting by Katie Paul and Rama Venkat, Editing by Dan Grebler, Jonathan Oatis and Richard ChangOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

"July 9, 2020",FB,"                Apax mulls sale of Neuraxpharm to lock in pharma sector premium: sources - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States DealsJuly 9, 2020 /  2:03 PM / 12 days agoApax mulls sale of Neuraxpharm to lock in pharma sector premium: sourcesArno Schuetze3 Min ReadFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Buyout group Apax is preparing the sale of German pharma group Neuraxpharm to try to lock in high valuations in the healthcare sector, fuelled by the coronavirus pandemic, sources familiar with the matter said. Apax has already held talks with several private equity firms to gauge their interest in the maker of antidepressants, painkillers and other products for the central nervous system and which could be valued at 1.2-1.4 billion euros, they said. An auction of the generics maker, which also sells medical cannabis, could launch in the European autumn, some of the people said, while other sources said Apax might opt to allow for more time before kicking off a sales process.  Apax has so far not hired an investment bank to handle a potential exit, while Rothschild or Jefferies are being tipped as possible advisers on an eventual deal, the sources said.  Global M&A activity tumbled to its lowest level in more than a decade in the second quarter, as companies gave up on expansion plans to focus on protecting their balance sheets in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. Healthcare is one of the few sectors that is expected to see only a relatively small 2020 impact on dealmaking from the pandemic, investment bankers say. “Healthcare valuations are high and some investors will now try to lock in premiums fuelled by the pandemic”, one banker said.  Other people said that Apax could wait until financing markets are back at pre-crisis levels for private equity buyers seeking cheap debt for buyouts. Neuraxpharm is expected to report earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of about 95 million euros ($107.58 million) this year and could be valued at 13-15 times that, the sources said.  Private equity groups including KKR, Advent, Nordic Capital, Bridgepoint, EQT, Cinven and Bain are being targeted as potential buyers, they added.  Apax bought Neuraxpharm in 2016 and combined it with Invent Farma and later it strengthened the company through add-on acquisitions such as FB Health and Farmax.  Credit ratings agency Moody’s said in January that after Neuraxpharm paid its owners a 90 million euro dividend, it expected leverage to remain above 6 time core earnings at least until 2021, despite a sound profitability with an adjusted EBITDA margin of around 27%.

"February 12, 2019",ATVI,"                Activision full-year forecasts miss, to cut nearly 800 jobs - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Technology NewsFebruary 12, 2019 /  9:27 PM / a year agoActivision full-year forecasts miss, to cut nearly 800 jobs3 Min Read(Reuters) - Activision Blizzard Inc forecast full-year profit and revenue below analysts’ estimates on Tuesday and said would invest more in developing its game franchises as the company faces intense competition from games such as “Fortnite”. FILE PHOTO: Attendees walk past a ""Call of Duty"" advertisement at the E3 2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2017.  REUTERS/ Mike BlakeHowever, the company’s profit beat estimates by a cent and the game publisher announced a new share buyback program of up to $1.5 billion, while saying it would cut about 800 jobs to focus on developing its games franchises, sending its shares up 3 percent in after-market trading. The company had 9,800 employees as of the end of 2017. As part of the restructuring actions, Activision expects to incur a pre-tax charge of about $150 million, the majority of which is expected to be incurred this year. However, Activision said the number of developers working on its games, such as “Call of Duty”, “Candy Crush” and “Overwatch”, in aggregate will increase about 20 percent over the course of 2019. “ATVI’s refocus on key game franchises over a net headcount reduction is the right path on returning to growth,” Benchmark Co analyst Mike Hickey said. Activision’s results follow weak reports from rival publishers Take-Two Interactive Software Inc and Electronic Arts Inc, adding to fears that competition from free-to-play battle royale games “Fortnite” and “PUBG” was eating into sales. The battle royale format, which allows dozens of players to battle each other until the last survivor, became wildly popular in 2018 and the two games have been credited with introducing newer audiences to gaming. “2019 will be a transition year for us,” Chief Financial Officer Dennis Durkin said. “Given limited frontline releases, the organizational work underway and the current competitive environment, we’re planning for this year to be down year-over-year,” Durkin added.         EA and Take-Two plunged last week as their forecasts came in short of analysts’ estimates. Activision’s full-year outlook for adjusted profit of $2.1 per share and revenue of $6.30 billion came in below Wall Street estimates. Analysts were expecting a profit of $2.54 per share and revenue of $7.25 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company said it will not generate material revenue from the “Destiny” game franchise in 2019 following the sale of publishing rights to Bungie in January. For the fourth quarter, Activision reported total adjusted revenue of $2.84 billion, missing estimates of $3.04 billion. Excluding items, the company earned $1.29 per share, just ahead of estimates of $1.28 per share.

REUTERS/Andrew KellyWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior Democrats on a House of Representatives oversight committee wrote to the new postmaster general on Monday to press him on reports the service was prepared to delay mail delivery if needed to cut costs, a move that could affect mail-in ballot results.  The U.S. Postal Service’s losses have soared even as it has become more critical to the U.S. economy as consumers, confined to their homes because of the coronavirus, shop online. A determination to avoid crowds will also mean that voting by mail will be more popular this November. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Trump appointee who took office in June, has detailed changes to the service that include eliminating overtime, even if it means that mail delivery is delayed. “While these changes in a normal year would be drastic, in a presidential election year when many states are relying heavily on absentee mail-in ballots, increases in mail delivery timing would impair the ability of ballots to be received and counted in a timely manner — an unacceptable outcome for a free and fair election,” wrote Representative Carolyn Maloney, chair of a government operations subcommittee of the Committee on Oversight and Reform. The letter was also signed by Representative Gerald Connolly, chair of a national security subcommittee, and  Representatives Stephen Lynch and Brenda Lawrence.   In a statement, Postal Service spokesman Dave Partenheimer said the agency was working on a plan to ensure it was financially stable. “It will certainly include new and creative ways for us to fulfill our mission,” he said. The Postal Service has been struggling as email and social media have replaced letters and after a 2006 law required it to pre-fund employee pension and retirement health care costs for the next 75 years. It is funded through services and postage. President Donald Trump has frequently criticized the post office, saying it charges too little to deliver packages sent by online retailers such as Amazon.com, whose founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos also owns the Washington Post.

FILE PHOTO: A white and orange cross with an ""A"" on it stands stuck in the ground along highway 17 at the entrance of the Satilla Shores neighbourhood where Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed young black man, was shot after being chased by a white former law enforcement officer and his son, at the Glynn County Courthouse in Brunswick, Georgia, U.S., May 8, 2020. REUTERS/Dustin Chambers/File PhotoAhmaud Arbery, 25, who was killed on Feb. 23 just outside the coastal town of Brunswick, became a touchstone in cross-country protests over racial and social justice in the United States. Arbery’s name has been proclaimed in chants and protest signs in demonstrations along with that of George Floyd, a Black man who was pinned to the ground by a white police officer in Minneapolis before he died on May 25. In the Georgia case, the three accused men were not charged for more than two months after Arbery was shot to death while jogging. State investigators were called to look at the case after cellphone video of the slaying was posted on social media. Former police officer Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son Travis, 34, are charged with murder and aggravated assault. Their neighbor who took the cellphone video, William “Roddie” Bryan Jr., 50, was charged with murder and attempt to illegally detain and confine. Police say Gregory McMichael saw Arbery running through his neighborhood outside of Brunswick and believed he looked like a burglary suspect. The elder McMichael called his son and the two armed themselves and drove after Arbery. Bryan joined the chase in his own vehicle, police say, and took video of the incident on his phone, which appears to show the McMichaels confronting Arbery before Arbery was shot with a shotgun. The accused will face Chatham County Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley. All three men will be arraigned, with several legal motions pending from the defendants’ lawyers. Bryan will also face a ruling on whether he can be released on bond.

As lockdowns lift, governments face a recovery climate choiceMatthew Green, Kate Abnett6 Min ReadLONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Despite mounting pressure for economic rescue packages to be used to tackle climate change, most of the money spent so far on overcoming the coronavirus pandemic has gone towards propping up business as usual, according to three studies.  FILE PHOTO: A Volkswagen E-Golf electric vehicle is displayed at the Canadian International Auto Show in Toronto, Ontario, Canada February 18, 2020.   REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File PhotoBut what comes next may be more important for the climate, as governments move from emergency mode and start planning – and spending – for a post-COVID-19 recovery. “There are a lot of different groups who are watching whether stimulus efforts are going to help or hurt the climate,” said Joel Jaeger, research associate at the World Resources Institute in Washington DC. “They are all coming to the same conclusion: the response so far has not been very green.”  The pandemic has already prompted the United States, Europe, China, Japan and others to commit trillions in stimulus funds, with further colossal injections expected within 18 months.  To climate advocates, these packages represent a once-in-a-generation chance to shift the world onto a low-carbon path by backing projects - such as renewables, efficient buildings and electric vehicles - to reduce heat-trapping carbon emissions. Christiana Figueres, a former U.N. climate chief who co-founded the environmental platform Global Optimism, has called stimulus spending “the last opportunity” to achieve the goals of the 2015 Paris climate accord. “The scale is such that it will determine the contours of the global economy over the next few decades,” Figueres told Reuters.  ‘WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY’ In the initial response, governments focused on blunting the impact of the pandemic, which sent billions of people into lockdown and endangered the earnings of nearly half the global workforce, according to the International Labour Organisation.  That meant funnelling large amounts of money into high-polluting mainstays of the pre-pandemic economy. G20 countries have so far committed at least $151 billion to support fossil fuel-heavy sectors, such as airlines, coal, oil and gas, and roadbuilding, according to an Energy Policy Tracker database launched this week by a group of research institutes and campaigners. By contrast, $89 billion had been committed to green energy, the database showed. In a separate study, consultancy Vivid Economics found that stimulus packages across 17 significant economies will pump about $3.5 trillion into sectors that have big impacts on nature, but largely fail to use the money to protect the environment. Advocates of “green recoveries” are now lobbying governments to pivot, encouraged by early support for some climate-friendlier stimulus in Germany, France and South Korea, and U.S. states such as New York and California. “We want to influence the recovery and there is still a window of opportunity,” said Ivetta Gerasimchuk, a Geneva-based policy expert at the International Institute for Sustainable Development.  GREEN TINGE IN EUROPE Europe has emerged as the leader in green recovery policies, although its plans have faced criticism from some campaigners for still falling short of what is needed to limit the rise in average global temperatures in line with Paris targets. EU states have so far devoted 0.31% of the bloc’s GDP to some form of green spending, relative to an average of 0.01% of GDP in Asia and North America, according to a third study by Bloomberg New Energy Finance. European Union leaders are meeting on Friday for their first face-to-face summit since the pandemic to attempt to clinch a deal on a massive 750 billion euro pandemic recovery fund.     The EU’s executive Commission says all spending from the fund must “do no harm” to its climate goals, although some researchers caution that safeguards are weak. “There’s been some promising noises coming from the EU but we need to see action,” said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, an energy think-tank in Nairobi. A 130-billion-euro package unveiled by Germany last month aims to boost electric vehicles and the use of clean hydrogen fuel. France has pledged 15 billion euros in near-term climate spending plus 8 billion euros to help electrify its automotive industry. Italy and Britain are supporting green building renovations, while Switzerland and Austria have sought to attach environmental criteria to airline bailouts. CHOICES LOOM FOR BIGGEST EMITTERS  While campaigners are pinning their hopes on the EU to set an example, prospects in the world’s two biggest carbon-emitting economies - China and the United States - are less certain. China has approved five new coal plants and is expected to rely on energy-intensive infrastructure and heavy industry to reboot its economy, although officials also extended subsidies for electric cars. Slideshow (4 Images)In the United States, the Trump administration has handed relief to oil and gas companies and curtailed environmental regulations. Trump’s opponent in November’s presidential election, Democrat Joe Biden, has pledged to spend $2 trillion over four years on clean energy infrastructure, however, and would likely face pressure to do more to cut emissions. “There will be a need for a sustained stimulus for at least two or three years,” said Mark Paul, an economist at New College of Florida. “It’s not one shot and done.” Reporting by Matthew Green and Kate Abnett, Additional reporting by David Stanway in SHANGHAI; Editing by Alex RichardsonOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

FILE PHOTO: Charles Thompson, an employee who says he was written up for wearing an ""I Can't Breathe"" mask last week, protests with coworkers outside the South Lake Union Whole Foods against store management not allowing workers to wear Black Lives Matter apparel in the aftermath of the death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, in Seattle, Washington, U.S. June 25, 2020. REUTERS/Lindsey WassonThe 14 plaintiffs in the proposed nationwide class action accused Whole Foods, a unit of Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), of sending workers home without pay or imposing disciplinary actions for wearing the masks and related apparel. Whole Foods said the masks violate its longstanding dress code banning clothing with “visible slogans, messages, logos or advertising” unrelated to the company. But the complaint filed in Boston federal court said Whole Foods has selectively enforced its code, and seeks an injunction to stop it from targeting Black Lives Matter supporters. Savannah Kinzer, a white plaintiff, said she was fired on Saturday after organizing co-workers in protest at a Whole Foods in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “Many companies are making enthusiastic statements about how they support Black Lives Matter and protests that have shaken up the country,” Shannon Liss-Riordan, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview. “Whole Foods and Amazon have portrayed themselves as champions of racial justice, but when their employees try to speak out, they get muzzled.” A Whole Foods spokeswoman declined to discuss the lawsuit, but said the company has “zero tolerance” for retaliation. She also said Kinzer was fired for lateness and missing shifts. Kinzer disputed this, and said Whole Foods has let employees wear masks bearing political messages and sports team logos, and let her wear a mask with the phrase “Soup is Good,” without incident. The plaintiffs come from four states, and several racial and ethnic backgrounds. More plaintiffs are expected. Black Lives Matter protests gained new strength after the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, where a police officer pinned his neck to the ground. On June 3, Amazon said “Black lives matter” and announced a $10 million donation to social justice organizations. The case is Frith et al v Whole Foods Market Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 20-11358.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.5%, paring a quarter of its 2% losses the previous day, while Japan’s Nikkei was almost flat. In China, the CSI300 index climbed 1.1%, clawing back some of Thursday’s 4.8% slide and shrugging off news that Washington is considering banning travel to the United States by all members of the Chinese Communist Party. Market watchers said investors are counting on U.S. policymakers to adopt more stimulus measures as the world’s largest economy struggles to contain the epidemic, with some existing programmes to support businesses set to expire within weeks. “The sustainability of this rebound will be determined to a large degree by whether another fiscal deal is reached,” said ANZ bank analysts in Sydney in a note. U.S. Congress is set to begin debating such a package next week, as several states in the country’s south and west implement fresh lockdown measures to curb the virus. “You would think such sharp rises in infections would normally lead to fall in stock prices but at the moment, that was being offset by strong hopes for vaccines,” said Tomo Kinoshita, global market strategist at Invesco in Tokyo. “But we now see higher risk of a market correction, considering the improvement in hard economic data we have seen over the past couple of months is likely to halt,” he said. While retail sales for June released on Thursday beat market expectations, real-time measures of retail foot traffic and employee working hours and shifts have flatlined after steady growth since April. The U.S. labour market remained in dire condition. There were 32 million people receiving unemployment checks under all programmes in the last week of June, down from the prior week but still the second-highest on record. Meanwhile U.S. stock futures rose 0.2% in Asia, recouping some Thursday’s losses when the S&P500 dropped 0.34% as investors locked in gains from rallies in high-flying tech shares ahead of earnings later this month. Kicking off technology sector results, Netflix skidded 9.0% after the bell as the company posted slower subscriber growth than Wall Street’s high expectations and forecast a further slowdown in the pace of expansion in the current quarter. In currencies, the euro was off the four-week high it touched earlier this week, but stayed firm as European Union leaders meet on Friday to seek to overcome differences over a proposed stimulus package to kickstart economic growth stifled by the coronavirus. On the table at a summit starting later in the day - their first in-person talks around a table since the pandemic - are the EU’s 2021-27 budget and a new recovery fund worth 750 billion euros ($854 billion), which would mark a major step towards fiscal integration in Europe. While Dutch opposition and the threat of a Hungarian veto weigh on chances for a deal, investors are pinning hopes on it being a question of when, rather than if, a deal is struck. “Whether they will come to an agreement today, or by the end of this month, or by later this year is anybody’s guess. But there is a swell of hopes that you have seen at the start of the euro trading,” said Masaru Ishibashi, joint general manager of trading at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank. The euro fetched $1.1386, unchanged on the day. The yen was flat at 107.50 per dollar. In commodities trading, oil prices were little changed with Brent down 0.25% at $43.26 per barrel and U.S. crude down 0.22% at $40.84.

"July 17, 2020",PINS,"                German investigators' access to private data must be limited - court - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Internet of ThingsJuly 17, 2020 /  8:59 AM / 4 days agoGerman investigators' access to private data must be limited - court2 Min ReadKARLSRUHE, Germany, July 17 (Reuters) - A German federal court said on Friday that several laws giving investigators access to personal internet or phone data were unconstitutional and needed to be amended to better protect privacy. The court ruling is a victory for privacy activists who had said there were not sufficient limits on when and why federal police or domestic intelligence can access the names and addresses or even e-mail passwords and mobile phone PINs of users. One of the suits on which the ruling published on Friday is based was filed by Katharina Nocun and Patrick Breyer of the Pirate Party, along with around 6,000 joint plaintiffs, in 2013. They had said that Germany’s telecommunications law gave investigators sweeping access to users’ private data, risking the creation of “a new secret police of the internet that can ransack and scan our most intimate thoughts”. The court said on Friday that investigators can in principle be given access to the data of users, but that laws needed to balance how urgently such data was needed - to fend off imminent danger or solve crimes - with the protection of legal rights. Otherwise they encroach on users’ right to determine the use of their data as well as on telecommunications privacy. Neither the existing laws regulating under which circumstances telecoms companies such as Deutsche Telekom can hand over the data, nor the ones determining why investigators can request such data, are in line with Germany’s constitution, the court said. Legislators will now have time until the end of 2021 to amend the laws, the court said.

FILE PHOTO: Airbus's annual press conference on Full-Year 2019 results in Blagnac near Toulouse, France, February 13, 2020.  REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File PhotoWorst affected are wide-body jets, demand for which is expected to come under pressure as the coronavirus crisis hits  airlines worldwide, especially in the long-haul Asia market. The European planemaker, whose factories are spread across Europe, restored output at French and Spanish plants a week ago after a four-day shutdown. On Monday it announced a new closure of Spanish plants that make tail sections of Airbus jets. Airbus said it would suspend most production in Spain until April 9 after the Madrid government tightened the coronavirus lockdown. It has also said British and German wings production and assembly would stop for three weeks. On Monday, union officials estimated 10-12% of Airbus staff were present at Airbus headquarters factories in Toulouse. An industry official put the total closer to 15%. “Activity has restarted on the A320 line, and very weakly on the (wide-body) A350 and A330,” said Francoise Vallin, Airbus coordinator for the CFE-CGC union. Airbus reiterated it had withdrawn 2020 targets. STRATEGIC SECTOR Despite a massive effort by the French government to keep strategic parts of the economy running with credit guarantees and initiatives to protect small businesses, parts shortages persist throughout the supply chain, industry sources said. Especially badly hit are the so-called tier-two or tier-three suppliers, which are sub-contractors to larger companies that deal directly with Airbus or its U.S. rival Boeing. “Up to half the French supply chain has been closed at some point but the situation is improving,” a senior executive said.     Airbus and other major aerospace companies have been left in no doubt that the French government sees it as a strategically important sector and should not risk collapse of the supply chain by closing operations completely, two senior sources said. The immediate priority is to safeguard defense and security activities linked to public infrastructure, one of them added. “The idea is not to stop everything totally, because getting the sub-contractors and suppliers going again could be a very long process,” Vallin said. By contrast with the auto sector, suppliers are expected to pick up speed only gradually as airlines resume flying and amass the cash needed to fulfill record orders. Airlines last week predicted a slower U-shaped recovery rather than a V-shaped one. France’s Safran (SAF.PA), the world’s third largest aero supplier, said last week it continued to deliver engines to Airbus and had enough parts for 2-to-3 weeks. But its chief executive noted some problems further down its supply chain. Slideshow (2 Images)Airbus is also finding it difficult to make deliveries because of the logistics of getting foreign pilots to France or Germany and the reluctance of many airlines to take aircraft as they face liquidity problems, industry sources said. Even such details as finding hotels are said to be a problem, forcing Airbus to look at using its own hotel and restaurant in its in-house academy known as Airbus University. Unions and some analysts have expressed surprise that it has not shut factories completely given the difficulty of making deliveries. The company has said it is taking every possible step to keep its people healthy and is not forcing anybody to work.

FILE PHOTO: Visitors gather outside the Nokia booth at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 26, 2019. REUTERS/Sergio Perez/File PhotoThe announcement, just as Europe prepares for the deployment of the next generation of mobile internet, or 5G, has political resonance in France because Nokia bought the unit five years ago on condition it would keep jobs. Nokia, which competes with Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and Huawei [HWT.UL] for 5G networks, said in a statement the staff reduction was needed because of significant cost pressures. Nokia said in April it aimed to cut costs by 500 million euros ($560.30 million) by the end of this year compared with full-year 2018, with 350 million euros targeted to come from operating expenses and 150 million from sales costs.  When Nokia bought Alcatel-Lucent International, it pledged to preserve jobs in France for two years and to expand research and development teams in the country to create a resource within the group for 5G technology. The French research and development teams are particularly affected by the job cuts. “Nokia must improve this job cuts plan really significantly,” an official at the French finance ministry official said on condition of anonymity. Nokia became free from the commitments it made this month, a spokeswoman said, while the company’s president in France said Nokia would still be a big source of jobs. “Nokia will continue to be a major employer in France with a strong foothold in R&D, sales and services, which will enable us to develop and execute our customers’ projects efficiently,” Thierry Boisnon, president of Nokia in France, said in written comments.     Nokia employs 5,138 people in France, of which 3,640 work for Alcatel-Lucent International.  Related CoverageNokia must 'really significantly' reduce job cuts in France, finance ministry official saysThe entity was part of the Alcatel-Lucent group before  Nokia bought it in 2015 in an all-share deal that valued the French business at 15.6 billion euros. The merger was scrutinised by the French government and its then economy minister Emmanuel Macron, who is now president. “It’s just a low-cost strategy that is being implemented, contrary to all the commitments made by Nokia in France. Nokia is laughing at everyone, first and foremost the French government,” the CFE-CGC union at Nokia said on its website.

The logo of Airbus is pictured at the entrance of the Airbus facility in Bouguenais, near Nantes, France, June 30, 2020. REUTERS/Stephane MaheAirbus is moving swiftly to counter damage caused by a 40% slump in its 55-billion-euro ($61.8 billion) jet business following the pandemic, balancing belt-tightening against aid offered by European governments and future priorities. But it faces tough talks with governments as well as unions, which immediately pledged to fight compulsory redundancies. A 2008 restructuring triggered rare strikes and protests. “It’s going to be a mighty battle to save jobs,” said Francoise Vallin of the CFE-CGC union. Europe’s biggest aerospace group said it would cut 5,000 posts in France, 5,100 in Germany, 900 in Spain, 1,700 in the UK, and 1,300 elsewhere by mid-2021, for a core total of 14,000.  The broader tally includes another 900 job cuts planned  before the crisis at its Premium AEROTEC unit in Germany. On June 3, Reuters reported reduced jet output pointed to cuts of 14,000 full-time posts. Earlier on Tuesday, French union sources predicted 15,000 cuts in total. Britain’s Unite union called the measures “industrial vandalism.” France’s hard-left Force Ouvriere union and others said they would oppose mandatory cuts. There was immediate political pushback in France, where the government of President Emmanuel Macron this month announced a 15-billion-euro support package for aviation. “The number of job cuts announced by Airbus is excessive. We expect Airbus to fully use instruments put in place by the government to reduce job cuts,” a finance ministry source said. Related CoverageAirbus CEO warns staff against national rivalries amid job cutsAirbus plans to cut jobs right across its UK operation: unionSee more stories Airbus refused to exclude sackings, but said it would first seek voluntary departures, early retirements and other measures. It wants to start implementing cuts this autumn and complete them next summer - a brisk deadline for such plans in Europe. Chief Executive Guillaume Faury said the company had been left with no choice by the dire industry crisis. “It is the reality we have to face and we are trying to give a long-term perspective to Airbus,” he told reporters. PRODUCTION OUTLOOK Airbus said in April it was reducing output by a third, but has raised that to 40% as it presses the case for job cuts. Sources say the discrepancy reflects different ways of measuring output on a weighted basis, rather than an immediate new cut. “We think we are rather stable now and there will be minor adjustments as we have in normal times,” Faury told Reuters.  But he added, “minor changes can be bigger than seen in past because there is more volatility in the market.” Exceptional secrecy had surrounded the politically sensitive restructuring affecting jobs in Britain, France, Germany and Spain, the company’s key backers in a fierce contest with U.S. rival Boeing for orders and industrial clout. About 37% of the 135,000-strong Airbus workforce is due to retire this decade, led by veterans of its best-selling A320. Boeing is cutting over 12,000 U.S. jobs, including 6,770 involuntary layoffs, after the pandemic compounded woes caused by the 15-month-old grounding of its 737 MAX.

REUTERS/Stephane Mahe/File PhotoAirbus’ programmes chief said it was slowing a push into after-sales services while maintaining a strategy of diversifying into the high-margin area. Some industry sources say Airbus has all but abandoned a goal of more than doubling services revenue to $10 billion this decade and transferred some staff to other roles.

FILE PHOTO: A logo of Airbus is seen at the entrance of its factory in Blagnac near Toulouse, France, July 2, 2020.  REUTERS/Benoit TessierThe battle over the scale and timing of cuts heated up as Air France (AIRF.PA) staff also waited for confirmation of 7,500 expected cuts in French aviation’s worst week for decades. Airbus unveiled the cuts on Tuesday, with France and Germany bearing the brunt of the restructuring with around 5,000 cuts each, while Britain is set to lose 1,700 jobs and Spain 900.  It has said it has no plans to close its dozen or so manufacturing sites spread across its four core nations but began detailing reductions at each plant in talks on Thursday. “Nobody has been spared,” said CFE-CGC union official Francoise Vallin outside Airbus headquarters in Toulouse. Airbus unions and leaders are at odds over whether the health crisis that restricted air travel and crippled airlines is a temporary one or the sign of more structural problems. At stake is how quickly Airbus can carry out its biggest ever shake-up and whether existing furlough schemes are enough. Airbus wants to act swiftly to pre-empt a second wave of the virus in the coming winter and counter what its chief executive has described as a structural shock to the aviation industry. It is looking for an agreement by the autumn and all cuts implemented by the summer of next year, which is seen as a relatively rapid timetable for big reorganisations in Europe. Related CoverageGermany can prevent job losses by supporting Airbus: CEO to SpiegelUnions want any adjustment spread out over a longer period, relying more on the ordinary pace of departures. They have declared a “red “line against compulsory job cuts, backed by  the French government which has called the plan “excessive”. “Natural departures are about 6,000 per year in the group, so if you spread it over two years, you can absorb part of the plan through natural erosion,” Jean-Francois Knepper of the Force Ouvriere union said. He declared the reorganisation plan “a cataclysm”.  SUPPLIER FEARS Talks begin in earnest on Monday with the CGT union calling a “day of action” among French aerospace workers on July 9. Some Airbus workers plan demonstrations a day earlier. Airbus has said it does not expect air travel to return to normal for 3-5 years. It is planning to cut 980 headquarters staff in Toulouse as part of the shake-up. After seeing its executive ranks grow in recent years, insiders say it has embarked on a battle against fixed costs.  Officials in Toulouse, Europe’s aerospace capital, are worried about the trickle-down impact of the job cuts on everything from small suppliers to shops and house prices.

REUTERS/Joseph CampbellSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Scientists in Singapore are hoping to perfect a new method of power generation driven largely by shadows, with the hope that it could one day help highly urbanised cities power themselves. The shadow-effect energy generator (SEG) being developed by the National University of Singapore has the potential to harness power like solar cells, but without needing open spaces with uninterrupted light. To work effectively, the SEG requires both light and dark and, like solar panels, relies on light to shine on silicon to energise electrons. However, using panels that feature a thin layer of either gold, silver, platinum or tungsten, the difference in light intensity drives electrons from lit areas towards the shade, creating electricity in the shaded areas. “Our shadow effect generator comes in handy. It can be placed in those areas to harvest obstructed light,” said research team leader Dr Swee Ching Tan. The research is still in its early stages yet Tan’s team is already thinking about the potential of establishing a company to make SEG available for home use. The panels the team have been testing are about 6 sq cm in size and capable of producing just 0.25 volts, meaning about 20 are needed to power a light bulb, or charge a cellphone. The ideal environment for use would be cities, Tan said, with constantly shifting levels of light and shade throughout the day from clusters of tall buildings and the sun’s changing position in the sky. “It’s not practical to place solar cells in such cities. So the device might come in handy in places like very densely populated cities, where skyscrapers are everywhere, where shadows are always persistent,” Tan said.

FILE PHOTO: Delegates wearing protective face masks attend the 44th session of the Human Rights Council at the European headquarters of the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, June 30, 2020. REUTERS/Denis BalibouseVenezuelan security and military forces fail to prevent  crimes and have participated in some violence against miners, the U.N. human rights office said in a report on Wednesday. “Authorities should take immediate steps to end labour and sexual exploitation, child labour and human trafficking, and should dismantle criminal groups controlling mining activities,” Michelle Bachelet, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement.  Her deputy Nada Al-Nashif presented the findings, on the area known as the Orinoco Mining Arc, to the Human Rights Council saying: “According to first-hand accounts received by the Office, a large portion of mining activities remain under the control of organised criminal or armed elements that impose their own rules through violence and extortion.” Venezuela’s ambassador, Jorge Valero, rejected the report in a speech that did not specifically mention mining. “It is clear that there is manipulation and double standards at play here with a view to try to attack a sovereign state and expose it,” Valero told the Geneva forum.  The U.N. report said that 149 people were reported to have died in or around the mines from March 2016 to 2020, with security forces implicated in half of the incidents, adding that the government had not replied to its request for information.  “According to accounts received ... bodies of miners are often thrown into old mining pits used as clandestine graves,” the report said.  The miners, who include young children, lack employment contracts and are exposed to mercury contamination and malaria, the report said. It called for the government of President Nicolas Maduro to regularise mining activities and ensure that they meet international legal and environmental standards.  Created by a government decree in 2016, the area of some 42,800 square miles (111,000 sq km) in ​​the Venezuelan Amazon is equivalent to 12 per cent of national territory.  Gold, diamonds, coltan, iron and bauxite are mined.  Venezuela’s central bank has not published data on gold and mineral exports since 2018, the report said. The Maduro government has supported small-scale mining since 2016 to bring in revenue amid an economic crisis. Operations have expanded as the United States has increased sanctions. Criminal groups have become more active since concessions for foreign mining companies were terminated in 2011, the report said.

FILE PHOTO: The South Korean and American flags fly next to each other at Yongin, South Korea, August 23, 2016.   Courtesy Ken Scar/U.S. Army/Handout via REUTERS/File PhotoU.S. Forces Korea (USFK) has reported at least 25 virus infections among its troops and employees in the past two weeks, including 11 on Monday. All were confirmed upon arrival or while spending two weeks in mandatory quarantine.  The surge has prompted Pyeongtaek, home to the sprawling Camp Humphreys south of Seoul, to ask the government to request a pre-departure test for incoming U.S. soldiers, a city official said.  “Luckily there’s no infection within the base reported so far, but we thought a prior test could curb the numbers and soothe concerns among residents,” the official told Reuters.  The USFK did not respond to a request seeking comment. But it has said it is taking aggressive quarantine measures, with fewer than 1% of active duty personnel having tested positive. All arrivals face a test, two weeks in isolation and a second test before release.  On Monday, health ministry official Son Young-rae described U.S. authorities’ response to the virus as “extremely strong”, adding that both sides are in close consultation on further steps.  A South Korean military official said more U.S. troops were confirmed infected as the current rotation season nears its end.  About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. Host to more than 20,000 soldiers, the Pyeongtaek garrison is the largest overseas U.S. base, sprawling over an area of 14.7 million square meters (17.6 million sq yards).  South Korea reported 39 new virus infections on Wednesday, among them 28 overseas travellers, for a 20th consecutive day of imported cases in double digits.  It unveiled plans this week to seek pre-departure tests of visitors from six countries, ranging from Bangladesh and Pakistan.

"July 17, 2020",SQ,"                In green jobs boost, communities get bigger role running Pakistan's national parks - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States AsiaJuly 17, 2020 /  8:03 AM / 5 days agoIn green jobs boost, communities get bigger role running Pakistan's national parksRina Saeed Khan7 Min ReadISLAMABAD (Thomson Reuters Foundation) -  For 20 years, Khunjerab National Park was a point of tension between Pakistan’s government - which established the park in 1975 as a sanctuary for rare species - and locals who had grazed their livestock on the land for generations. As disputes over the land raged, poachers decimated Khunjerab’s wildlife, villagers say - until 1995, when local people and the authorities decided to work together to better protect the park. “Our communities knew about natural resource management (and) we were well organised,” said Muzaffar ud Din, a founding member of the local Shimshal Nature Trust, which contributed members to a community-led management group set up to run the park.  “Now I would say Khunjerab is better managed than many other parks in the country. The local people look after it. The wildlife population has increased manifold,” he said.  In its latest move to generate jobs amid the COVID-19 pandemic while boosting conservation and curbing the impacts of climate change, Pakistan has announced the creation of Pakistan’s first National Parks Service, modeled on the U.S. agency. Under it, the country aims to get more local communities involved in running national parks and earning an income as they protect nearby conservation areas. The first phase of the Protected Areas Initiative, launched on July 2, will focus on 15 national parks that make up a total of 7,300 sq km (2,800 sq miles), spanning from Khunjerab in the north to the area around Astola Island in the south. The project aims to create up to 5,000 new jobs, mainly for young people who will work as park guards and custodians, and boost eco-tourism in the country, authorities said when the initiative was announced. Malik Amin Aslam, climate change advisor to Prime Minister Imran Khan, said the parks plan fits into Pakistan’s post-coronavirus “green stimulus” vision, which also includes hiring thousands of unemployed day labourers to plant trees as part of the country’s 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.  here “The dual objective is to protect nature while also generating jobs for unemployed youth,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “All this green activity will aid in addressing the unexpected spike in COVID-linked unemployment across the country.” ‘PAPER PARKS’ Pakistan currently has about 30 national parks that are supposed to be protected and preserved by law. But most are “paper parks” - areas classified as national parks but with little or no management, said Aslam, who helped design the new initiative. Conservation expert Anis ur Rahman estimates only about 5% of the country’s parks are properly managed. The others suffer from clashing priorities and a lack of cooperation between the government and the communities that live around them and rely on them for grazing, hunting and firewood, he explained. “In many cases, the government changed the status of these old community-managed forest areas or grazing areas into national parks where (suddenly) everything is prohibited by law,” said Rahman, who heads the management board for Margalla Hills National Park, one of those included in the new project. “But there is weak enforcement. The government does not have the resources to pay for adequate protection,” he said. Many of the country’s environmental experts see Khunjerab, the country’s oldest and largest national park, as a model of successful community-led management.  The park was established 45 years ago as a way to protect the area’s glaciers, alpine pastures, streams and ravines. Parts of it were closed off to create undisturbed habitat for animals from the rare Marco Polo sheep to snow leopards and Siberian ibex. But that move pitted the government against local livestock farmers, who had long used the area. here Ashiq Ahmed Khan, a wildlife specialist working at the government’s Pakistan Forest Institute in the 1990s, helped draft the first management plan for the park that brought together locals and the provincial wildlife department. Under the plan, eight villages inside the park agreed not to graze livestock in its 12-square-kilometre core zone. In exchange, other grazing areas were designated on a rotation that gave each time to recover after being used, noted Khan, who is now retired. Community members were employed as guards and game inspectors, with 80% of employment opportunities in the park going to locals. It was also agreed that local communities would receive 75% of the revenue generated by visitor fees. “It really was the first national park in the country whose management plan was actually implemented,” Khan said. “Today there are 100 Marco Polo sheep in the park, much more than the eight or nine I saw (in the 1990s) and there are more than 5,000 ibex.” STRONGER LAWS? So far, Pakistan’s authorities have revealed few details about the new Protected Areas Initiative. Aslam, the climate change advisor, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the project will be overseen by Pakistan’s new National Parks Service, due to launch in September.  He said the country had earmarked 4 billion rupees ($24 million) for the initiative’s first phase over the next three years, of which at least 80% would be spent on creating green jobs and increasing community engagement. Through the project, the amount of protected land in Pakistan will increase from 13% to 15% by 2023, Aslam added. But environmental lawyer Rafay Ahmad Alam said that while the initiative is a positive step, it will do little to help preserve Pakistan’s green spaces without legislation to back it up.  The initiative “won’t make up for the fact that (most of) the provincial national park laws are weak and don’t provide adequate specifics for conservation, protection or enforcement measures,” he said. Aslam agreed that proper provincial legislation is essential and noted that changes to policy are also part of the new plan. The shift to community-managed parks offers the chance to tap into the “amazing indigenous knowledge” that local people possess about the land, Muzaffar ud Din said. “Local communities have more information and they can manage their own natural resources better. They have better vision,” he said. “National parks should not be viewed as a separate entity, but as part of the overall socio-economic and physical landscape. That is the future of conservation.” Reporting by Rina Saeed Khan, Editing by Jumana Farouky and Laurie Goering.

Theodore’s left hand was caught in the illegal trap, potentially restricting blood flow and causing infection if left untended. But before they could do anything, they had to deal with his over-protective parents.    The rangers sedated Theodore’s mother, distracted his 600-lb (270-kg) silverback father, laid the furry baby on the leafy jungle floor and got to work.  “There was a lot of commotion, the silverback wasn’t happy but they were able to move fast and effectively enough to apply antibiotics and treat the baby gorilla,” said Emmanuel De Merode, director of Virunga National Park.  Procedures like this are common in Democratic Republic of Congo’s Virunga park, a vast wonderland of deep forests, glaciers and volcanos, with more species of birds, reptiles, and mammals than any other protected area in the world.  But they are under threat.  The economic impact of COVID-19 has caused a spike in poaching, threatening the habitat of more than half the world’s mountain gorillas, park authorities said, just as rangers are forced to reduce their presence to shield from the virus.  The 7,800 sq km (3,000 sq miles) area was closed to tourists in March to help staunch the spread of the coronavirus to the local community and the great apes. Slideshow (5 Images)Higher food prices, fewer job opportunities, and a collapse of tourism revenues mean people living in and around the park have had to turn to the forest to survive, finding alternatives such as hunting for bush meat. “There has been an increase in the number of people going into the forest to lay those snares,” he said. As for Theodore, he had a lucky escape. Although risky for the vets and rangers because of his formidable father, his operation was successful.

REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File PhotoThe core consumer price index (CPI) was flat, with slower falls in energy prices in June helping the gauge out of negative territory. The reading dashed expectations for a third straight month of decline and followed central bank comments last week that the economy would likely shake off the hit from the pandemic. Japan lifted nationwide state of emergency measures in late May but has seen a renewed spike in infections in its capital Tokyo, stoking fears of a second wave of infections that could curtail spending in an already weakened economy. “It is inevitable that the outlook for wage environment will become severe as firms could cut bonuses and payments due to significant deterioration in corporate earnings,” said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. “We can’t expect a V-shaped economic recovery and a lack of demand including that of overseas could become chronic, so  downward pressure on prices could strengthen.” The core CPI, which includes oil products but excludes volatile fresh food prices, was flat in June from a year earlier, government data showed on Tuesday. That compared with the median market forecast of a 0.1% decline and falls of 0.2% reported in both April and May. The so-called core-core price index, which excludes food and energy prices and is closely tracked by the central bank as a narrower gauge of inflation, grew 0.4% in June after the same rate of gain in May.    The Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) latest quarterly forecasts showed consumer prices projected to fall 0.5% this fiscal year to next March and stay well below its 2% target through early 2023. The economy likely contracted more than 20% in April-June as the coronavirus hit global growth and the government shut down the economy from April to late May. They said recovery in the world’s third-largest economy is expected to be modest as the pandemic exacts a heavy toll on exports, business activity and jobs. Japan has reported over 25,000 infections and around 1,000 deaths.

FILE PHOTO: Ethan Brown, founder and CEO, Beyond Meat, speaks at the Milken Institute 21st Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., May 1, 2018.    REUTERS/Mike Blake(Reuters) - Plant-based meat maker Beyond Meat Inc on Tuesday increased the expected price range and size of its initial public offering, ahead of an expected market debut on Thursday, indicating strong investor demand. The company said it expects to offer 9.63 million shares, up from 8.75 million shares and the IPO to be priced between $23 and $25 per share, up from $19 and $21 per share, its latest filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed.  The higher end of the indicative price range gives the company a market value of $1.49 billion, up from $1.21 billion earlier. Plant-based meat substitutes have been gaining popularity as more attention is focused on the environmental hazards of industrial ranching. The Los Angeles-based company in early January announced it was rolling out its plant-based burger at fast-food chain Carl’s Jr. Investors in Beyond Meat include actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Microsoft Corp founder Bill Gates. Tyson Foods Inc, the no. 1 U.S. meat processor, owned a 6.5 percent stake in Beyond Meat, but last week said it sold its investment in the vegan burger maker, as it looks to develop its own line of alternative protein products. Beyond Meat’s net loss narrowed marginally to $29.89 million in the year ended Dec. 31, from $30.38 million a year earlier. Net revenue more than doubled to $87.93 million in the same period. The company expects to start trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol “BYND”. Goldman Sachs, J.P.Morgan, Credit Suisse are the lead underwriters to the IPO.

Citron also made remarks on its stance in shares of Beyond Meat Inc, which Left in May said on Twitter he was shorting because valuations had become “Beyond Stupid.” In Citron’s investment letter, the firm said: “While Citron can’t justify Beyond Meat’s (BYND) absurd valuation, we cannot ignore unfavorable technical dynamics (e.g., tight float and high borrow cost). We were able to capitalize on trading around our position in Beyond Meat, which was another top contributor to fund performance during 1H 2019.” In May, Left said Citron believed Beyond Meat shares would go back to $65 a share. Beyond Meat shares are currently  trading around $170 a share.

"February 27, 2020",BYND,"                Beyond Meat posts profit miss, dragged by investment, marketing costs; shares fall - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsFebruary 27, 2020 /  9:09 PM / 5 months agoBeyond Meat posts profit miss, dragged by investment, marketing costs; shares fallRicha Naidu, Praveen Paramasivam5 Min Read(Reuters) - Beyond Meat Inc (BYND.O) on Thursday missed quarterly earnings expectations due to higher costs, and said Executive Chairman Seth Goldman would give up his executive status, while remaining chair of the board, sending shares down 10% in after-hours trade. The plant-based meat company said deals with retailers and restaurants substantially narrowed its loss and boosted sales. But Beyond Meat reported a 1 cent per share loss during the period, versus analyst expectations of a 1 cent profit, according to according to Refinitiv IBES data. Beyond Meat has never recorded a yearly profit due to spending on R&D, marketing and its fast-paced international expansion. In the most recent quarter, the company’s restructuring and some administrative costs were higher. The El Segundo, California-based company - whose Beyond Burgers and Sausages are driving a global craze for plant-based meat products - struck several high-profile deals last year with fast-food chains including McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) and Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O). As consumers grow increasingly health-conscious and concerned about the environmental impact of industrial animal farming, the plant-based meat market is expected to expand to $140 billion. The company’s share price has risen four-fold since its IPO in May, but short sellers and many investors view the stock as overvalued following its massive surge, now trading at 232.8 times expected earnings.  “There were very high expectations for BYND going into this earnings release,” CFRA Research analyst Arun Sundaram said. “However, we wouldn’t be surprised if the stock bounced back a bit tomorrow once the market opens.” “Seth Goldman’s step down as executive chair is a bit shocking to us. You don’t typically see one of the early pioneers of the company shedding responsibilities during the very critical growth stage of company,” Sundaram said. Goldman joined Beyond Meat as executive chair and as a member of the company’s board in February 2013. Beyond Meat’s products are sold by grocers including Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Whole Foods. Its deals with restaurants include Starbucks Corp’s SBUX.N recent announcement that it will soon sell a Beyond Meat breakfast sandwich across Canada. But while Beyond Meat and its main rival Impossible Foods race to sign on major global restaurant chains, there have been some signs of issues including Canadian restaurant chain Tim Hortons dropping Beyond Meat’s products from its menu, saying they were not “embraced” by customers during a trial. Last month, Burger King began cutting the price of its Impossible Burgers, adding them to its value menu. Initial feedback on the Beyond Burger has been largely positive, based on checks with some Ontario-based McDonald’s currently testing the plant-based burgers in Canada, Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard wrote last month in a note. Howard said, however, that it seemed the McDonald’s trial had not yet been a blowout success that justified an immediate nationwide rollout across both Canada and the United States. Net revenue grew to $98.5 million from $31.5 million a year ago, beating estimates of about $80 million, in the period ended Dec. 31. Beyond Meat said it expects net revenue of $490 million to $510 million this year, an increase of 64%-71% from 2019, about in line with expectations. Beyond Meat’s net loss narrowed substantially to $0.5 million, or a loss of 1 cent per common share.

REUTERS/File Photo“We have a kind of cannibalistic approach to innovation where we’re trying to take out our existing products and there’s a lot of pride in doing that,” Chief Executive Ethan Brown said in an interview on Thursday. Boosted by rising sales the company’s full-year loss has narrowed since 2017, even as it spends on a new facility in the Netherlands and is working to start production in Asia by the end of this year. In recent months, the coronavirus outbreak has slowed manufacturing in China. Beyond Meat said its goal remains to produce in the region by end of year, pending abatement of the coronavirus. “We’re looking, like everyone else, at when things are going to clear ... but it’s not something we’re wringing our hands about it here,” Brown said.

"July 16, 2018",NFLX,"                FANG surge leads stock market recovery, putting Netflix in spotlight - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Business NewsJuly 16, 2018 /  11:09 AM / 2 years agoFANG surge leads stock market recovery, putting Netflix in spotlightCaroline Valetkevitch, Noel Randewich5 Min ReadNEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The FANGs have gotten their bite back, and they are helping Wall Street erase the wrenching correction that beset it in February. FILE PHOTO: A trader points to a screen that displays FANG+, group of highly-traded technology and tech-enabled companies, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, NY, U.S., July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File PhotoFacebook, Amazon.com, Netflix and Google’s parent Alphabet have led the technology and consumer discretionary sectors back to record high levels in recent days. Whether they can haul the wider market over that threshold likely hinges on the rush of quarterly scorecards due soon from the four of them, starting with Netflix late on Monday. A star performer in the quartet of the so-called FANG stocks that have fueled the market’s gains in recent years, Netflix has surged 106.2 percent year-to-date, leading the S&P 500 and making it one of Wall Street’s most closely-watched stocks. Outsized gains this month from a range of tech stocks, the FANGs included, have brought the S&P 500 to within striking distance of its Jan. 26 record high close. To view a graphic on FANG stocks since Jan 26, click: reut.rs/2LfuF8V Also fueling gains, Microsoft’s stock market value on Thursday exceeded $800 billion for the first time, below only Apple, Amazon and Alphabet on the U.S. stock market. On a conference call Thursday, Credit Suisse Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Jonathan Golub said he sees technology and FANG companies becoming even more central to Wall Street’s rally as they outcompete traditional consumer corporations. “Tech is going to inherit the earth,” Golub said. “They’re actually delivering much more than everyone else.” Netflix has posted an average gain of about 7 percent the day after each of its previous four quarterly reports.  Wall Street’s recovery has been uneven. Six of the S&P’s 11 sectors remain in negative territory for the year, while the S&P 500 is up 4.8 percent, just 2.5 percent short of its January high.  The S&P 500 tech index, which led last year with a 37-percent rise, is up more than 15 percent so far this year. The consumer discretionary index, which includes Amazon and Netflix, is up about 14 percent, and sits at No. 2.  To view a graphic on Sector Performance, click: reut.rs/2NN7AMB Even as U.S. President Donald Trump escalates a trade war with China that could hurt U.S. consumers and companies, investors have remained largely optimistic about stocks, pointing to corporate tax cuts that are boosting profits and share buybacks.  S&P 500 companies are expected to post 20.9 percent earnings per share growth for the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data. Technology earnings are seen rising 25.5 percent, while consumer discretionary profits are seen up 16.1 percent, helped by Amazon.com and Netflix.  Stock valuations are more reasonable now than back in January, with the S&P 500 price-to-earnings multiple at 16, roughly its five-year average. It was above 18 in January when stocks began tumbling.      The FANGs are far pricier than the wider market, however, with Netflix at 111 times expected earnings, Amazon at 106, Alphabet at 25 and Facebook at 24, which places even greater focus on their earnings and forecasts in the weeks ahead. “These companies would be revalued if, for whatever reason, their earnings or revenue growth really began to wane. But right now, it’s not the case,” said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. “They have the kind of top-line growth that is the envy of the rest of the companies in the S&P 500.”  Fueled by massive spending on shows like “Altered Carbon” and “O Mecanismo”, Netflix has said it expects to have added 6.2 million new subscribers in the June quarter. Los Gatos, California-based Netflix is expected, on average, to report a 41 percent jump in revenue to $3.94 billion and earnings of 79 cents per share, up from 15 cents per share a year before, according to Thomson Reuters data. “NFLX may well be the best global, secular growth story in tech, and we believe investors would likely take advantage of any earnings-related weakness,” JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a recent client note.

"October 17, 2018",NFLX,"                Netflix shares jump after record subscriber growth - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Hot StocksOctober 17, 2018 /  11:01 AM / 2 years agoNetflix shares jump after record subscriber growth2 Min ReadOct 17 (Reuters) - Shares of Netflix Inc soared 11 percent before the bell on Wednesday after the company put fears of a slowdown in growth to bed by racking up 7 million new subscribers between July and September. The video streaming pioneer shocked Wall Street last quarter by falling short of new subscriber estimates, but Tuesday’s figures put its total customer base at 137 million worldwide, 2 million more than consensus forecasts. At least eight brokerages raised price targets on the stock, with three of them, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Raymond James, raising them just two days after trimming. “We don’t believe in ‘open-ended growth stories.’ But, darn, NFLX is about as close to one as you can find in today’s market,” RBC analyst Mark Mahaney said in a note. Analysts pointed to the streaming giant’s ‘solid trends’ in India, and said homegrown shows there like Sacred Games and Ghoul bode well for future growth as it ramps up across some of the developing world’s most populous markets. “NFLX shies away from talking about any one international market too specifically, but it called out growth in Asia, and we believe India is becoming a bigger factor,” said JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth. Goldman Sachs raised its price target by $50 to $480. The brokerage had earlier cut price target to $430 from $470. Shares of the company were up 11 percent at $384.51 before the bell.

"July 18, 2019",NFLX,"                Netflix shares sink 11%, analysts still see growth - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsWorldPoliticsTVMoreUnited States Hot StocksJuly 18, 2019 /  12:31 PM / a year agoNetflix shares sink 11%, analysts still see growth3 Min ReadJuly 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street brokerages stuck to a positive outlook on Netflix Inc on Thursday, betting that a strong content slate for the rest of 2019 would reverse shock losses in U.S. subscribers in the second quarter that sank its stock price. Shares in the company fell 11% in early trade, as investors worried over lower-than-expected global growth and signs of trouble in its U.S. base. Six brokerages cut their share price targets to reflect the dip in the shares, but there were no cuts to their ratings on the stock, still seen by a majority of Wall Street firms as a high-potential growth business and a clear “buy”. The company added just 2.83 million international paid streaming subscribers, compared with street expectations of 4.8 million. Brokers Cowen & Co calculated it had missed expectations for second-quarter subscriber numbers three times in the last four years. “The subscriber miss wasn’t unprecedented, though the international miss magnitude was greater than normal,” RBC Capital Markets analysts said. “But Q2 results do highlight the importance of a strong content slate and at least raise the question of whether NFLX needs to be more restrained with price increase pacing.” Netflix, which has 151.6 million customers, raised prices in Britain, Switzerland, Greece and Western Europe in the quarter. Morningstar analysts said the company had conditioned users to expect strong original content every quarter and when the slate is weak or less known, the ability to drive marginal subscribers to join or renew becomes harder, especially when prices are rising. The company began the third quarter with the release of its 1980s-set smash-hit “Stranger Things” and will follow it with new seasons of “Orange is the New Black,” and “The Crown” as well as hotly-awaited Martin Scorsese movie “The Irishman”. “We would note Netflix misses have been followed by strong quarters, and, along those lines, we expect Netflix’s very strong 2H slate will lead to a rebound in sub growth,” Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a client note. The company forecast it would gain 7 million subscribers globally in the third quarter, when it will also launch new seasons of hit Spanish-language series “La Casa de Papel” and the second season of Indian series “Sacred Games.” Netflix also laid out an extensive expansion plan in India, including 5 new originals, a prequel series to India’s epic fantasy franchise “Baahubali” and rolling out a lower-priced mobile-only plan within the next three months.
