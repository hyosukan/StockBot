By Peter Apps LONDON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Sometime last week, a small group of Chinese residents were sitting outside in the town of Chengdu. A small drone approached them, hovered nearby and began to speak. “Playing mahjong outside is banned during the epidemic,” said a voice from the drone. “You have been spotted. Stop playing and leave the site as soon as possible.” “Don’t look at the drone, child,” it continued. “Ask your father to leave immediately.” For many in the rest of the world, what China’s Global Times described as a “creative use” of drones to tackle its coronavirus outbreak may still sound like a scene from a futuristic dystopia. Those in power in Beijing, however, clearly view it as something to be proud of. The video was shared widely on Chinese social media platforms such as Weibo and showcased in its English-language media for consumption abroad. It was, perhaps, an indicator of two important things. Firstly, not only is China keen to use all means at its disposal to contain the coronavirus outbreak, but it may well use it to harden, strengthen and demonstrate the growing capabilities of the most sophisticated surveillance state the world has ever known. Secondly, of course, it demonstrates the proliferation of sophisticated, smaller unmanned vehicles and platforms as a tool for mass surveillance – as well as outright social control. That’s a trend likely to be seen well beyond the world’s more authoritarian states, and it is that one democracies will need to have a much more public and accessible conversation about than they have managed so far. LAW ENFORCEMENT The uses for often already overstretched law enforcement and other security services are obvious. On Sunday, two people were stabbed in London by a recently released extremist, raising questions about the ability of authorities to keep track of individuals deemed risky. Automated technology solutions such as facial recognition software make that easier, but clearly also unsettle many. In the United States, several towns and cities including Oakland and Berkeley in California and Cambridge, Massachusetts, have outright banned the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement. Other states and locations are considering tighter controls – but across much of the rest of the United States and Western world, surveillance technology continues to be rolled out, sometimes largely unnoticed and unchallenged. Much larger unmanned weapons-carrying drones have been at the centre of U.S. operations in the Middle East and beyond for years. Where the United States has led, China has often followed. Beijing is a major supplier of large armed drones to countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, frustrated by limits on U.S. drone exports. The next revolution, however, looks to involve much smaller drones that while less lethal, can also be a much more intrusive presence. In August last year, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Project Agency demonstrated a drone swarm at Fort Benning, Georgia, that used largely off-the-shelf technology to autonomously locate, find and monitor a specified object in a particular building – a city hall – in a U.S. military training complex. The aim is for swarms of up to 250 devices to be able to operate largely independently or controlled by a single operator, providing a level of mobile surveillance and coordination not previously available. DRONE TECHNOLOGY For now, the Chinese example demonstrates the limitations of that technology. Beijing has been pouring resources into drone and surveillance technology for decades. In 2018, the South China Morning Post reported that included developing flocks of unmanned aircraft designed to resemble birds such as doves in both appearance and movement. Such devices, it said, have already seen service along China’s borders and in its north-western Xinjiang province, where a crackdown on Muslim minority ethnic Uighurs has long been a testbed for Beijing’s surveillance state. These devices, it said, have proved convincing enough that they can be flown over flocks of sheep – normally very sensitive to aircraft – without the animals determining their true nature. In the long run, Beijing almost certainly wants to match that technology with its other surveillance tools – widespread static cameras, and a colossal facial identification database the state has been building since 2015. Other tools reportedly developed by China include systems to identify people by their distinctive walking gaits. The surveillance drones in the Global Times videos, however, are clearly under the control of individual human operators, their voices broadcast by loudspeaker.  Another video from Jiangsu province, eastern China, showed a policewoman using a drone to check passengers at a crossing wearing masks. “The handsome guy who is on the phone, where is your mask? Put it on please,” she said through its loudspeaker. “The girls who were eating food while walking, put on your masks please. You can eat when you arrive at home.” It’s a reminder that for all its investment in technology, like previous mass surveillance states such as East Germany China remains dependent on using humans to watch other humans. That, however, is changing very quickly. Artificial intelligence algorithms, combined with the colossally larger data trails humans already leave, has already proved a game changer when it comes to targeted advertising. Numberplate recognition cameras mean most vehicles in most countries have their locations recorded sometimes dozens of times a day. According to the “Global Times”, China’s citizens viewed the Chengdu footage as useful entertainment while they stayed inside following the cancellation of Lunar New Year festivities. Whether that is true is another question – but it’s an issue the rest of the world may also find itself grappling with sooner than it thinks. *** Peter Apps is a writer on international affairs, globalisation, conflict and other issues.

(AMD)amended its wafer supply agreement with GLOBALFOUNDRIES in December 2012, whichreduced burdensome prior minimum purchase commitments, though we expect AMD'snegative free cash flow to continue in 2013.       -- We are lowering our corporate credit and senior unsecured issue ratings on AMD to 'B' from 'BB-', and removing the ratings from CreditWatch with Negative implications.     -- The outlook is stable. Despite our expectation for AMD's leverage to climb above 7x over the coming year, we believe the company has the opportunity to stabilize its operating performance in 2013 through product introductions, potential embedded product design wins, and recently announced restructuring initiatives and has sufficient liquidity to bridge this period of expected weak earnings.  Rating ActionOn Jan. 8, 2013, Standard & Poor's Rating Services lowered its corporate credit and senior unsecured ratings on Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) to 'B' from 'BB-'. At the same time, we removed the ratings from CreditWatch, where we had placed them with negative implications on Oct. 12, 2012. The downgrade reflects our expectation for continued revenue and earnings declines resulting in leverage exceeding 7x over the coming year due to weak PC industry demand prospects and intense competition from industry peers, including Intel.RationaleThe 'B' corporate credit rating reflects AMD's ""vulnerable"" business risk profile, characterized by intense competition from  Intel Corp., as well as prospects for tablet computing to continue to subdue PC industry growth and AMD's earnings over the coming year, resulting in leverage expected to exceed 7x and our assessment of AMD's financial risk profile as ""highly leveraged."" The ratings also reflect the company's ""adequate"" liquidity. Our management and governance assessment is ""fair.""AMD faces challenges from ARM-based competitors, which are currently designing products for fast-growing tablet and smartphone markets. We expect smartphone and computing tablet growth to continue to reduce industry demand for x86-based (a family of computing instruction set architectures) computing and to support cloud-based server demand, constraining AMD's prospects for revenue and earnings over the coming year. We also expect AMD's revenue performance to remain constrained by competition from industry leading Intel. Our financial risk profile for AMD reflects the company's prospects for increasing leverage over 7x over 2013, from under 3x in 2011. Considering industry competition, we still expect that AMD has an opportunity to reduce leverage below 5x subsequent to 2014, though we expect the company to face execution challenges to increase its presence in new markets, including analog product markets, absent growth to its overall research and development (R&D) spending. We note that AMD announced in October 2012 its plan to reduce its quarterly operating expenses, including R&D, to $450 million by third-quarter 2013, representing an approximate 25% reduction from 2012 first-quarter levels.LiquidityAMD maintains adequate liquidity from internal sources. The company doesn't have a revolving credit facility at this point. Cash amounted to $1.48 billion on Sept. 29, 2012. We expect that payments to GLOBALFOUNDRIES related to the December 2012 contract amendment and severance payments related to the company's 15% workforce reduction announced in October 2012 will contribute to continuing negative free cash flow in 2013. Despite AMD's negative free cash flow prospects during 2013, we expect AMD to maintain cash above its minimum target of $700 million over the coming 12 months without the need for additional debt, other than sales leaseback proceeds anticipated to amount to between $150 million and $200 million. We expect coverage of liquidity uses by sources to exceed 1.2x for the next 12 to 24 months and believe that net sources would be positive over the coming 12 months, even with a 15% to 20% decline in EBITDA. Recovery analysisFor the complete recovery analysis, see Standard & Poor's recovery report on AMD, to be published as soon as possible on RatingsDirect following this release. OutlookThe outlook is stable. Despite our expectation for AMD's leverage to climb above 7x over the coming year, we believe the company has an opportunity to stabilize its operating performance in 2013 and has liquidity sufficient to bridge this period of weak performance. Improvements should come through product introductions, potential embedded product design wins, and recently announced restructuring initiatives. A downgrade could result from a number of developments, including protracted low demand, further erosion of market share, or weaker manufacturing execution. Any of these scenarios could weaken the financial profile that supports the rating. Specifically, we would consider a lower rating if liquidity were likely to fall below $700 million or prospects to reduce leverage below 7x in 2014 diminish. Considering AMD's competitive challenges, an upgrade is unlikely at present.

AMD will expand its push into the small but growing microserver market, combining ARM’s architecture typically used in smartphones with the x86 architecture common in servers, Chief Executive Officer Rory Read said on Monday. “AMD is the only computing company on the planet that’s introducing this ambidextrous architecture spanning both x86 and ARM ecosystems,” he told reporters at an event. One of Silicon Valley’s oldest chipmakers, AMD is losing money and struggling to redefine itself as consumers increasingly favor tablets over laptops and as manufacturers worried about the economy hold off on building new PCs. The company, which is a distant No. 2 to top chipmaker Intel Corp, announced this month it would slash 15 percent of its workforce, while devoting more resources to areas outside of its traditional PC business, including communications, industrial and gaming applications.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

(AMD) to negative from stable. We also affirmed our 'BB-' corporate credit rating on the company.At the same time, we assigned our 'BB-' issue-level rating to AMD's proposed $300 million senior unsecured notes due 2022.The outlook revision reflects our view of the company's prospects for near-term operating weakness and its plan to refinance its August 2012 notes maturity, resulting in our anticipation of higher leverage over the next 12 months.The proposed notes will rank equally with all of AMD's existing and future senior unsecured debt. The company intends to use the proceeds from this offering, along with available cash, to refinance all of its $485 million outstanding senior unsecured convertible notes maturing Aug. 15, 2012.RationaleThe 'BB-' corporate credit rating reflects AMD's ""weak"" business risk profile, characterized by intense competition from Intel Corp. and the threat of competition from ARM-based (a type of computing instruction set) competitors, partly offset by the company's moderately leveraged balance sheet at this point, which we characterize as a ""significant"" financial risk profile. The ratings also reflect the company's ""adequate"" liquidity. We expect smartphone and computing tablet growth will reduce demand for x86-based (a family of computing instruction set architectures) computing and will support cloud-based server demand. We expect AMD's prospects for new product sales following the anticipated launch of Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system in the fourth quarter of 2012 will provide AMD an opportunity to resume revenue and profit growth and reverse near-term revenue and margin declines, which could result in modest revenue and EBITDA growth--as well as the potential for leverage to decline under 3x--in the second half of 2013. We expect AMD's continued commitment to R&D spending, in excess of 20% of revenues, will enable it to retain modest server market share, in support of revenue growth.Over the longer term, we expect that AMD's revenue performance will remain constrained by competition from Intel, given Intel's ""strong"" business risk profile. AMD, with about $6.4 billion revenues and $900 million EBITDA for the latest 12 months ended June 30, 2012, possesses a relatively modest x86 unit and revenue market share relative to Intel, which has much larger share (about 95% unit share) in server markets, as well as 85% unit share in notebook markets, and over 75% unit share in desktop markets, as measured by International Data Corp. AMD faces challenges from ARM-based competitors as well, which are currently designing products for fast-growing tablet and smartphone markets. We expect tablet markets will constrain, but not eliminate, AMD's prospects for revenue and profit growth. For 2012, we expect AMD's revenues will decline about 10% year over year due to weak global macro conditions, especially in Europe; competition from Intel; and tablet substitution from Apple and others. We expect AMD's 2012 EBITDA will decline 25% due to its investments in 28 nanometer production, inventory correction, and volume reductions. We expect 2012 reported free cash flow to amount to decline substantially from $528 million in 2011, due to lower volume, inventory correction, and about $50 million payments we anticipate it will pay to its primary wafer supplier, GLOBALFOUNDRIES (GF) before April January 2013 (a total of $225 million to be paid by April 2013). Our financial risk profile for AMD reflects the company's debt to EBITDA of about 2.5x as of June 30, 2012 and prospects for increasing leverage over 3.0x during the next several quarters. We expect leverage will subside below 3.0x later in 2013.LiquidityAMD maintains adequate liquidity from internal sources. The company at this point doesn't have a revolving credit facility. Cash and marketable securities amounted to $1.8 billion at June 30, 2012. We expect that by refinancing--rather than repaying--the $485 million August 2012 notes maturity, the company will maintain cash above its minimum target of $1.5 billion.Our assessment of AMD's liquidity profile incorporates the following expectations, assumptions, and factors:     -- We expect coverage of uses to be in excess of 1.2x for the next 12 to 24 months.     -- We believe that net sources would be positive in the near term, even with a 15% to 20% decline in EBITDA.     -- Debt maturities are well paced, with maturities of less than $600 million in any one year and spread through 2020. AMD plans to limit debt maturities to no more than $500 million per year as part of its long-term capital structure goal. Recovery analysisFor the complete recovery analysis, see the recovery report on AMD, to be published separately on RatingsDirect.OutlookThe outlook is negative, reflecting decreasing near-term operating performance and increased leverage. A downgrade could result from a number of developments, including protracted lower demand, erosion of market share, or weaker manufacturing execution. Any of these scenarios could weaken the financial profile that supports the rating. Specifically, we would consider a lower rating if liquidity fell below $1 billion or if leverage were to be sustained above 3x. We would consider an outlook revision to stable if leverage was on a trajectory to be sustained in the mid-2x range.

Baker3 Min Read(Reuters) - Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices is at the initial stage of reviewing whether to split itself in two or spin off a business, seeking to reverse its fortunes and take on rival Intel Corp, according to three people familiar with the matter. An AMD Opteron 6000 series processor is seen on a motherboard during a product launch in Taipei April 14, 2010.  REUTERS/Pichi Chuang The deliberations are preliminary and no decision has been made, the people said. The review highlights Chief Executive Lisa Su’s determination to consider every possible option to turn the company around. AMD has asked a consulting firm to help it review its options and draw up scenarios on how a break-up or spin-off would work, the people said this week, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. One option under consideration is separating AMD’s graphics and licensing business from its server business, which sells processors that power data centers, one of the people said.  AMD had explored such a move in the past and decided against it, the people said. Su, however, who took over as CEO last October, judged that there is merit for the company to at least consider such a possibility again, the people added. There is no certainty that a split or spin-off will occur, the people cautioned. A spokeswoman for AMD declined to comment.  AMD, which has a market capitalization of around $2 billion, has competed with much larger Intel since the 1980s, and at times has made inroads with its PC and server chips. AMD has an extensive cross-licensing agreement with Intel, an issue AMD would have to study carefully in the case of a break-up. In the last few years, AMD has been caught somewhat flat-footed by new competitors designing low-cost and power-efficient chips. AMD shares have fallen 40 percent over the last 12 months. The Sunnyvale, California-based company, which said in October it would cut 7 percent of its workforce, is now shifting its focus to gaming consoles and low-power servers to combat falling laptop sales. While large rivals such as Intel have deeper pockets to fund research on new products, AMD faces declining cash flows and has a more modest balance sheet. AMD’s net loss widened to $180 million, or 23 cents per share, in the quarter that ended March 28, from $20 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier. It also missed on revenue expectations.

There is no certainty that a split or spin-off will occur, the people cautioned. A spokeswoman for AMD declined to comment.  AMD, which has a market capitalization of around $2 billion, has competed with much larger Intel since the 1980s, and at times has made inroads with its PC and server chips.

The Sunnyvale, California-based company, which said in October it would cut 7 percent of its workforce, is now shifting its focus to gaming consoles and low-power servers to combat falling laptop sales. While large rivals such as Intel have deeper pockets to fund research on new products, AMD faces declining cash flows and has a more modest balance sheet. AMD’s net loss widened to $180 million, or 23 cents per share, in the quarter that ended March 28, from $20 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier. It also missed on revenue expectations.

The review highlights Chief Executive Lisa Su’s determination to consider every possible option to turn the company around. AMD has asked a consulting firm to help it review its options and draw up scenarios on how a break-up or spin-off would work, the people said this week, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.

0,AMD,"April 25, 2012","                TEXT-S&P raises Advanced Micro Devices rating to 'BB-' - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsIndiaSouth AsiaTVMoreIndia Regulatory NewsApril 25, 2012 /  3:57 PM / 8 years agoTEXT-S&P raises Advanced Micro Devices rating to 'BB-'9 Min ReadOverview	     -- U.S. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced in February 2012 itsplans to de-lever through repayment of $485 million notes due August 2012.	     -- AMD recently amended its wafer supply agreement with foundry partner 	GLOBALFOUNDRIES in March 2012 and as a result, AMD may source 28 nanometer 	wafers from alternate suppliers, to the potential benefit of its revenues and 	operating profitability.	     -- We are raising our corporate credit and senior unsecured issue ratings 	on AMD to 'BB-' from 'B+', removing the ratings from CreditWatch Positive.	     -- The stable outlook reflects our expectation that AMD's financial 	profile will offset ongoing and considerable business risk.   		Rating Action	On April 25, 2012, Standard & Poor's Rating Services raised its corporate 	credit and senior unsecured issue ratings on Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Advanced 	Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) to 'BB-' from 'B+'. At the same time, we removed the 	ratings from CreditWatch, where they were placed with positive implications on 	Jan. 31, 2012. The rating outlook is stable.		The upgrade reflects AMD's improved financial profile, along with an improved 	business risk profile. It also reflects the company's prospects for further 	revenue, earnings, and market share stability, given improved execution of 	wafer supply from GLOBALFOUNDRIES (GF), recent contractual amendments with GF, 	and AMD's commitment to ample product development spending. 		AMD maintains a simple capital structure, composed of a modest amount of 	capital leases (about $30 million outstanding at March 31, 2012) and about 	$2.1 billion of senior unsecured notes, due between 2012 and 2020, including 	two senior unsecured convertible note tranches. We rate AMD's senior unsecured 	notes at 'BB-' (the same as the corporate credit rating) with a recovery 	rating of '3', indicating average (30%-50%) of recovery in the event of a 	payment default. 		Rationale	The 'BB-' corporate credit rating on AMD reflects the company's ""weak"" 	business risk profile, characterized by intense competition from Intel Corp. 	and the threat of competition from ARM-based (a type of computing instruction 	set) competitors, partly offset by AMD's ""significant"" financial risk profile, 	with considerable support provided by its lightly leveraged balance sheet and 	""adequate"" liquidity. Our assessment of the company's business risk profile 	also incorporates AMD's commitment to R&D spending, which we expect will 	continue to represent about 22% of revenue.		We expect smartphone and computing tablet growth will reduce demand for 	x86-based (a family of computing instruction set architectures) computing and 	will support cloud-based server demand. We expect x86-based and server demand 	will provide AMD an opportunity to achieve further revenue and profit growth. 	We expect that AMD's revenue growth will remain constrained by competition 	from Intel, given Intel's ""strong"" business risk profile. With about $6.5 	billion revenues and $930 million EBITDA for the latest 12 months ended March 	31, 2012, AMD possesses a relatively modest x86 unit and revenue market share 	relative to Intel, which has much larger share (about 95% unit share) in 	server markets, as well as 85% unit share in notebook markets, and over 75% 	unit share in desktop markets, as measured by IDC. 		AMD faces challenges as well by ARM-based competitors, which are currently 	designing products for fast-growing tablet and smartphone markets. We expect 	tablet markets will grow to represent in excess of 25% of collective PC and 	tablet units worldwide over the next several years and will constrain, but not 	eliminate, AMD's prospects for revenue and profit growth.		We have revised our business risk profile for AMD to weak from ""vulnerable,"" 	reflecting our anticipation of further profit stability and growth due to the 	company's recent wafer amendment with GF, which provides AMD with greater 	flexibility to source wafers from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd 	(TSMC), if needed. AMD's EBITDA margins have stabilized over the past several 	years at about 15%, following the company's divestiture of its manufacturing 	assets to GF. We expect AMD's R&D spending will continue to represent about 	22% of revenues in the future, given the brevity of industry product 	lifecycles and intense competition.		We have revised our financial risk profile for AMD to significant from 	""aggressive,"" reflecting the company's improving financial metrics, including 	debt to EBITDA of about 2.3x as of March 31, 2012, adjusted for operating 	leases and stock compensation, as well as strong free cash flow in excess of 	about $400 million annually since September 2011. We expect AMD's financial 	leverage will decline to about 1.9x after the anticipated debt reduction later 	in 2012. Although the company's financial metrics currently appear stronger 	than indicated by our financial risk assessment, its relatively short track 	record at current levels and execution risks in highly competitive markets 	drive its weak financial risk profile. 		Considering AMD's outsourced manufacturing business model, we expect that 	capital expenditures will continue to represent only about 4% of revenues and 	free cash flow will amount to about $500 million annually. 		Liquidity	AMD maintains adequate liquidity from internal sources. The company currently 	has no plans to obtain a revolving credit facility. Cash and marketable 	securities amounted to $1.7 billion at March 31, 2012, down about $200 million 	from about $1.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2011, due primarily to about $293 million 	cash spent to acquire SeaMicro, a server provider to cloud-based computing 	markets, in the March quarter. We expect that AMD, given its liquidity 	profile, will be able to fund remaining nonrecurring amendment payments to GF 	(about $275 million through the March quarter of 2013), repay its August 2012 	notes' maturity ($485 million), and maintain cash above its minimum target of 	$1.5 billion.		Our assessment of AMD's liquidity profile incorporates the following 	expectations, assumptions, and factors:	     -- We expect coverage of uses to be in excess of 1.2x for the next 12 to 	24 months.	     -- We believe that net sources would be positive in the near term, even 	with a 15% to 20% decline in EBITDA.	     -- Debt maturities are well paced, with maturities of less than $600 	million in any one year and spread through 2020. AMD plans to limit debt 	maturities to no more than $500 million per year as part of its long-term 	capital structure goal. 		Recovery analysis	For the complete recovery analysis, please see our recovery report on AMD, to 	be published separately on RatingsDirect.		Outlook	The outlook is stable. We expect AMD's financial profile to offset ongoing and 	considerable business risk. A rating downgrade could result from a number of 	developments, including sharply lower demand, erosion of market share, or 	weaker manufacturing execution. Any of these scenarios could weaken the 	financial profile that supports the rating. Specifically, we would consider a 	lower rating if liquidity fell below $1 billion or if leverage was on a 	trajectory to exceed 3x. 		We would consider a higher rating once AMD builds a track record of stable to 	growing market share and earnings have been well established, leading us to 	conclude the leverage could remain over time at or below 2x. Given AMD's 	competitive and cyclical operating environment, an upgrade is unlikely over at 	least the next 12 to 18 months.

0,AMD,"January 30, 2013","                TEXT - Fitch cuts Advanced Micro Devices issuer default rating - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsIndiaSouth AsiaTVMoreIndia Regulatory NewsJanuary 30, 2013 /  7:48 PM / 8 years agoTEXT - Fitch cuts Advanced Micro Devices issuer default rating6 Min ReadJan 30 - Fitch Ratings has downgraded the following ratings for AdvancedMicro Devices Inc.'s (NYSE: AMD):--Long-term IDR to 'CCC' from 'B';--Senior unsecured debt to 'CCC/RR4' from 'B/RR4'. Fitch's actions affect approximately $2.1 billion of total debt.The ratings reflect Fitch's expectations that negative free cash flow (FCF) in 2013 will drive cash below AMD's target level and potentially approach the company's minimum operating level. Beyond the near-term, Fitch believes a strongend market recovery and adoption of AMD's new products will be required to preserve cash during the company's multi-year transformation. Fitch expects negative revenue growth in the mid- to high-teens for 2013, drivenby weak consumer spending, robust tablet penetration and lingering excess channel inventory anticipated for the first half of the year. Revenue growth could turn positive in the back half of 2013, assuming strong sales of AMD's newproducts.Negative revenue growth will drive profitability lower in 2013, despite restructuring actions expected to reduce quarterly operating expenses to $450 million by the September 2013 quarter. Fitch expects negative FCF of $250 million to $450 million in 2013 from lower profitability levels and inventory builds related to new product ramps.AMD's cash usage will be amplified by cash payments to GLOBALFOUNDRIES (GF) for amendments to the wafer supply agreement (WSA), including $215 million in fiscal2013 and $200 million at the beginning of fiscal 2014. These cash outflows couldbe partially offset by proceeds from AMD's proposed office building sale-and-leaseback transaction.AMD is planning first half of 2013 launches of system-on-a-chip (SoC) accelerated processors for ultra-low power mobility and tablet products and solid revenue growth in the second of 2013 from ramps of a broad set of design wins. Delays to these launches, the expected market recovery, or product sales ramps would exacerbate Fitch forecasts.Credit protection measures will remain volatile, due to variations in profitability. Fitch estimates total leverage was 4.2x for 2012 but may approach10x in 2013. Fitch estimates interest coverage was 2.8x for 2012 but could fall to 1x in 2013.AMD's transformation targets higher-growth markets, including ultra-low-power mobility, high-density servers and semi-custom embedded products. Given AMD's traditional PC markets represent the vast majority of sales, achieving the company's target of 40%-50% of sales from higher-growth markets will require a number of years.Fitch believes liquidity was sufficient as of Dec. 29, 2012, and consisted of $1.18 billion of cash and cash equivalents, including $181 million of long-term marketable securities. Fitch expects negative FCF of $250 million to $450 million for the current year, pressuring liquidity by the end 2013. The company has a stated target cash level of $1.1 billion and minimum operating cash level of $700 million. Total debt was $2.1 billion at Dec. 29, 2012 and consisted of:--$580 million of 6% senior unsecured convertible notes due 2015;--$500 million of 8.125% senior unsecured notes due 2017;--$500 million of 7.75% senior unsecured notes due 2020;--$500 million of 7.5% senior unsecured notes due 2022; --Approximately $25 million of capital leases.AMD's ratings continue to be supported by: --Low capital intensity as a fabless semiconductor maker, resulting in a stronger FCF profile; --Reduced revenue breakeven profitability, pro forma for the completion of current restructuring initiatives; --The company's role as the only current viable alternative microprocessor supplier to Intel, although Fitch expects new entrants in certain markets over the intermediate term.Fitch's concerns center on:--Limited financial flexibility, given cash usage trends;--AMD's modest share of the overall PC market and limited share in rapidly growing small-form factor mobility products; --High R&D intensity as a fabless semiconductor maker.Further negative rating actions could be taken if the penetration of new APU products is lackluster, resulting in revenue declines and cash usage beyond 2013. Positive rating actions could occur if:--FCF exceeds the upper end of Fitch's base case range; --Strong adoption of new products, portending solid revenue growth and positive FCF in 2014.AMD's Recovery Ratings (RRs) reflect Fitch's belief that the company would be reorganized rather than liquidated in a bankruptcy scenario. This is given Fitch's estimates that AMD's reorganization value of approximately $1 billion exceeds a projected liquidation value of $682 million. To arrive at a reorganization value, Fitch assumes a 4x reorganization multiple and applies it to its estimate of distressed operating EBITDA of $260 million, which covers estimated annual fixed charges, resulting in an adjusted reorganization value of $939 million after subtracting administrative claims. Fitch estimates the approximately $2.1 billion of unsecured claims recover approximately 45%, resulting in an RR of 'RR4'.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

0,AMD,"October 29, 2012","                Advanced Micro adopts smartphone technology for servers - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsIndiaSouth AsiaTVMoreIndia iPadOctober 29, 2012 /  9:40 PM / 8 years agoAdvanced Micro adopts smartphone technology for serversNoel Randewich5 Min ReadSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc plans to use technology from Britain’s ARM Holdings Plc to make energy-efficient processors for servers, a growing business that the troubled chipmaker hopes will help offset weakness in the struggling PC industry. AMD will expand its push into the still-new microserver market, combining ARM’s architecture typically used in smartphones with the x86 architecture common in PCs and servers, Chief Executive Officer Rory Read said on Monday. “AMD is the only computing company on the planet that’s introducing this ambidextrous architecture spanning both x86 and ARM ecosystems,” he told reporters at an event. One of Silicon Valley’s oldest chipmakers, AMD is losing money and struggling to redefine itself as consumers increasingly favor tablets over laptops and as manufacturers worried about the economy hold off on building new PCs. The company, which is a distant No. 2 to top chipmaker Intel Corp, announced this month it would slash 15 percent of its workforce, while devoting more resources to areas outside of its traditional PC business, including communications, industrial and gaming applications. AMD’s focus on microservers is a clear — albeit indirect — bet on the proliferation of smartphones, tablets and other personal computing devices. “The data center is where we fundamentally think the growth is going to be and where the innovation is going to be,” said Lisa Su, AMD’s senior vice president and general manager, global business units. BATTERY FRIENDLY Like Intel, Sunnyvale, California-based AMD was caught flat-footed in recent years with the emergence and fast growth of mobile devices like Apple’s iPad. Nearly all smartphones and tablets now use battery-friendly technology licensed by ARM to chipmakers like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics. AMD’s adoption of ARM’s technology comes as the British company turns toward data centers, where servers using its low-power technology are challenging the powerful Intel processors that currently power most servers. AMD also makes similar x86 server chips. When it comes to web surfing on tablets, or analyzing activities on Facebook in real time, data centers with many small, efficient processors are more efficient than those with a few large processors, said Patrick Moorhead, the head of Moor Insights & Strategy. “The new realm of servers is being driven by changes in client devices like smartphones and tablets,” Moorhead said. “What mega-data center builders are doing now is trying to find the most optimal architecture, and what they’re looking at very closely are microservers.” ARM has been working on its own 64-bit chip technology, a standard suited to data centers that takes better advantage of memory than its 32-bit chip technology used in smartphones and tablets. Intel and AMD already use 64-bit technology in their x86 server processors. AMD executives said they will focus on 64-bit server chips using ARM technology, with products expected in 2014. They said AMD may eventually use ARM’s technology for other kinds of chips as well. AMD has previously talked about plans to follow a strategy of adding other companies’ intellectual property to its future chip designs, mixing and matching different technologies to suit customers’ needs. Read, who left PC maker Lenovo last year to lead AMD, told analysts on a recent quarterly conference call that he had underestimated how quickly the PC industry was changing. He said AMD had to speed up its transformation. AMD expects its revenue to fall 10 percent in the current quarter compared with the September quarter. Reflecting the chipmaker’s troubles, AMD’s stock has fallen 59 percent over the past year. AMD took a step into the microserver market in March with the acquisition of Silicon Valley startup SeaMicro for $334 million, But it is not the only company to bet on microservers. Austin, Texas-based startup Calxeda is also focusing on ARM-based processors for data centers and Intel is working on low-powered versions of its x86 chips. Dell and Hewlett-Packard have also said they plan to sell ARM-based servers. With years of execution setbacks also weighing on AMD, the company is burning through cash, and industry analysts have recently become concerned about future liquidity. AMD’s cash declined $279 million in the third quarter to $1.48 billion. AMD said it was reducing its “optimal” cash target to $1.1 million from $1.5 billion due to the business’ now smaller size.

AMD will expand its push into the still-new microserver market, combining ARM’s architecture typically used in smartphones with the x86 architecture common in PCs and servers, Chief Executive Officer Rory Read said on Monday. “AMD is the only computing company on the planet that’s introducing this ambidextrous architecture spanning both x86 and ARM ecosystems,” he told reporters at an event. One of Silicon Valley’s oldest chipmakers, AMD is losing money and struggling to redefine itself as consumers increasingly favor tablets over laptops and as manufacturers worried about the economy hold off on building new PCs. The company, which is a distant No. 2 to top chipmaker Intel Corp (INTC.O), announced this month it would slash 15 percent of its workforce, while devoting more resources to areas outside of its traditional PC business, including communications, industrial and gaming applications. AMD’s focus on microservers is a clear — albeit indirect — bet on the proliferation of smartphones, tablets and other personal computing devices. “The data center is where we fundamentally think the growth is going to be and where the innovation is going to be,” said Lisa Su, AMD’s senior vice president and general manager, global business units. BATTERY FRIENDLY Like Intel, Sunnyvale, California-based AMD was caught flat-footed in recent years with the emergence and fast growth of mobile devices like Apple’s (AAPL.O) iPad. Nearly all smartphones and tablets now use battery-friendly technology licensed by ARM to chipmakers like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics. AMD’s adoption of ARM’s technology comes as the British company turns toward data centers, where servers using its low-power technology are challenging the powerful Intel processors that currently power most servers. AMD also makes similar x86 server chips. When it comes to web surfing on tablets, or analyzing activities on Facebook in real time, data centers with many small, low-power processors are more efficient than those with a few large processors, said Patrick Moorhead, the head of Moor Insights & Strategy. “The new realm of servers is being driven by changes in client devices like smartphones and tablets,” Moorhead said. “What mega-data center builders are doing now is trying to find the most optimal architecture, and what they’re looking at very closely are microservers.” ARM has been working on its own 64-bit chip technology, a standard suited to data centers that takes better advantage of memory than its 32-bit chip technology used in smartphones and tablets. Intel and AMD already use 64-bit technology in their x86 server processors. AMD executives said they will focus on 64-bit server chips using ARM technology, with products expected in 2014. They said AMD may eventually use ARM’s technology for other kinds of chips as well. AMD has previously talked about plans to follow a strategy of adding other companies’ intellectual property to its future chip designs, mixing and matching different technologies to suit customers’ needs. Read, who left PC maker Lenovo last year to lead AMD, told analysts on a recent quarterly conference call that he had underestimated how quickly the PC industry was changing. He said AMD must accelerate its shift toward designing embedded chips for fast-growing markets like game consoles and medical equipment. “Get the business balanced, simplify the portfolio, lower the cost base, then go after embedded (chips) �. That’s in the tactical time frame,” Read told Reuters in an interview, asked about AMD’s strategy for the next few months. AMD expects its revenue to fall 10 percent in the current quarter compared with the September quarter. Reflecting the chipmaker’s troubles, AMD’s stock has fallen 59 percent over the past year. AMD took a step into the microserver market in March with the acquisition of Silicon Valley startup SeaMicro for $334 million, But it is not the only company to bet on microservers. Austin, Texas-based startup Calxeda is also focusing on ARM-based processors for data centers and Intel is working on low-powered versions of its x86 chips. Dell DELL.O and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) have also said they plan to sell ARM-based servers. With years of execution setbacks also weighing on AMD, the company is burning through cash, and industry analysts have recently become concerned about future liquidity. AMD’s cash declined $279 million in the third quarter to $1.48 billion. AMD said it was reducing its “optimal” cash target to $1.1 million from $1.5 billion due to the business’ now smaller size.

The S&P 500 technology sector, which was at the heart of the recent selloff, provided the biggest boost to the benchmark S&P 500 index, which was on course for its third day of gains. Advanced Micro Devices Inc gained 14.7% after the chipmaker launched its second generation of processor chip and said that it had landed Alphabet Inc’s Google and Twitter Inc as customers. Symantec Corp jumped 11.6% after sources said chipmaker Broadcom Inc was in advanced talks to buy the cybersecurity company’s enterprise business. “The overnight action was positive. That, along with the bounceback yesterday, gave us a nice tailwind coming into the market today, both for high-frequency traders who were buying the trend and also for bargain hunters who had seen stocks that were on the watchlist come down to a level that looked attractive,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “So we’ve seen a lot of the tech names pop after they got hammered. There’s money coming back into those because investors have decided it created an opportunity.” U.S. data pointed to a robust labor market as the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, allaying some worries about a recession and helping U.S. Treasury yields rise. That followed better-than-expected export numbers out of China and some improvement for the country’s yuan currency, whose slide over the weekend spurred Wall Street’s worst day so far this year on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 285.32 points, or 1.1%, to 26,292.39, the S&P 500 gained 45.67 points, or 1.58%, to 2,929.65 and the Nasdaq Composite added 154.78 points, or 1.97%, to 8,017.61. On the down side, Kraft Heinz sank after it pulled its full-year forecast and wrote down the value of several business units by over $1 billion, capping a rough few months for the company. Lyft Inc advanced 4.1% after the ride-hailing service raised its annual outlook and hinted at the end of its price war with Uber Technologies Inc. Uber, due to report after the bell and a high-profile loser since its market launch this year, rose 7.5%. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.52-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 38 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 84 new lows.

The three main Wall Street indexes jumped more than 1% on Tuesday after China stepped in to steady the yuan, easing fears that currencies would be the next weapon in the trade war between the United States and China. Despite Tuesday’s gains, the benchmark S&P 500 is still about 5% away from the record high it hit last month. Shares of technology companies, including Apple Inc and chipmakers, were higher before the bell. The iPhone maker’s shares rose 0.8%, while those of Intel Corp, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Nvidia Corp gained more than 1%. At 6:56 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 87 points, or 0.34%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 9.5 points, or 0.33% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 40.25 points, or 0.54%. With the second-quarter earnings season winding down, about three quarters of the 413 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far have topped earnings estimates. Match Group Inc jumped 18% after the online dating services provider forecast third-quarter sales above estimates, as its popular app Tinder attracted more users in the reported quarter. Walt Disney Co dropped 3.6% after its quarterly earnings missed analysts’ forecast as the company invested heavily in its streaming platform and began folding in assets purchased from Twenty-First Century Fox. Cambrex Corp soared 45% after the contract development and manufacturing company said it was being bought by an affiliate of private equity firm Permira Funds for about $2.02 billion.

In the quarter that ended in June, Applied Micro Circuits recognized its first revenue from the chips - about a $1 million - and the company said it expects “meaningful” revenue from the chips in the quarters ending in December and March as shipments build. “There is backlog today on the books for X-Gene, both in the September quarter and December quarter, as well as the March quarter,” Chief Executive Officer Paramesh Gopi told analysts on a conference call.

Intel dominates the server market and it stands to lose if server chips based on a rival architecture catch on, even if only a few percentage points of market share. “While we don’t take any competition lightly, the much-hyped threat of ARM servers getting any significant market segment share any time soon has been vastly overplayed,” said Intel spokesman Bill Calder.

The unveiling late on Sunday took the industry by surprise. Nvidia offered few details beyond basic specifications. Executives said that when it launches, it will be able to run Google Android games now found on smartphones and tablets. It can also stream games from PCs. “Everything you do with your Android device just works here,” Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang told reporters in Las Vegas ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show. “This is the culmination of five years of work.” Nvidia is keeping a tight lid on Project Shield, with only a handful of closely guarded prototypes circulating within the company, a source at Nvidia told Reuters. Huang would not say when the device — or the Tegra 4 that powers it — will begin selling, or at what price. Tablets and smartphones support limited control functions like swiping and tapping. By integrating a controller with a screen, Nvidia may be angling for hardcore gamers who play shooter and other intense action games on consoles. Developers have not yet been successful in bringing such titles to mobile devices like the Apple iPad, analysts say. “At first glance, this does seem more primed for attacking the mobile and tablet consumer sector rather than impacting the Microsoft or Sony HD console experience,” said Jesse Divnich, an analyst at video game research firm EEDAR. Others said Nvidia may be trying to vie for a bigger slice of the console gaming market. Microsoft now uses graphics chips from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc for its Xbox, the market leader. Apart from a growing assortment of game-capable tablets and smartphones, Sony and Microsoft are both expected to release next-generation versions of the PlayStation and Xbox this year. Nvidia’s new device will support the popular game digital download service “Steam”, bringing on board top-selling titles like “Assassin’s Creed” and “Battlefield 3”. “Nvidia has really been a hardware consumer-facing company for nearly 15 years in the graphics card business,” PJ McNealy, CEO of Digital World Research, said. “It’ll be a challenge to leverage that legacy into a broader hardware business.” SHIELD Beyond gaming, entertainment features like Hulu and Netflix have become a unique selling point for Sony’s PlayStation and Microsoft’s Xbox consoles. “Nvidia is many years way from trying to penetrate that market,” Divnich said. With PC sales suffering due to economic uncertainty and a growing consumer preference for tablets, Nvidia has also staked its future on leveraging its graphics expertise to make high-performance processors for mobile devices. The Tegra 4 chip, with four central processing cores, will be Nvidia’s first to include LTE technology for high-speed telecommunication networks. The company has made inroads in tablets but competition from larger rival Qualcomm has some on Wall Street concerned the company may struggle to keep its mobile business growing fast. Qualcomm already offers 4G technology in its chips. Huang said Nvidia’s newest Tegra boasts improved image processing capabilities for digital cameras in phones and tablets. Huang also said the Tegra 4 chip lets tablets load web pages more quickly than devices using rival chips. The previous Tegra 3 is used in Google’s Nexus 7, one of only a handful of tablets to make inroads against Apple’s iPads. The Tegra 3 chip is also used in Microsoft’s recently launched Surface tablet. At the event, Huang also introduced a cloud product called the Nvidia Grid, a server and software package designed to remotely handle graphics computations for video games instead of on consoles like the Xbox in game-players’ living rooms. He said Nvidia would sell the Nvidia Grid packages to companies interested in hosting and streaming cloud-based video games.

JPMorgan Chase & Co rose 1.4 percent to $42.68 in premarket trading after reporting a 34 percent jump in third-quarter profits as the largest U.S. bank made more home mortgage loans. But Wells Fargo & Co lost 1.8 percent to $34.55 in premarket trading after reporting its third-quarter results. The earnings of both banks will be scrutinized for insight on the health of the financial sector and the economy as a whole. Both had been forecast to benefit significantly from a home loan refinancing boom. “The banks are a huge part of what is going on - they have been trading below tangible book value, which means people don’t believe what is on their books, so any time we get information on them, that could be a driver for the market,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “So people are going to be analyzing the results from JP Morgan and trying to figure out if things in the economy are getting better or staying the same.” The benchmark S&P index has shed 1.9 percent so far this week, putting it on track for its worse weekly performance since a 3-percent drop in the week through June 3. Weak global demand has heightened investor worry over the corporate earnings season. As a group, S&P 500 companies’ third-quarter earnings are expected to fall 3 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data, marking the first decline in three years. Economic data is due, in the form of the September producer price index at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT) and the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers preliminary consumer sentiment index for October at 9:55 a.m. (1355 ET). Producer prices are expected to show a 0.7 percent rise compared with a 1.7 percent rise in August. Economists in a Reuters survey expect a consumer sentiment reading of 78.0 compared with 78.3 in the final September report. Investors will eye the PPI data for any signs of inflation while consumer sentiment will be monitored for indications recent labor market data helped boost views on the economy. S&P 500 futures rose 3.7 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures gained 24 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 3.5 points. Advanced Micro Devices Inc dropped 8.1 percent to $2.94 in premarket trading after the chipmaker said its third-quarter revenue likely fell 10 percent from the previous quarter as a weak global economy and a growing preference for tablets slams the PC industry. European shares fell and looked set to end the week in negative territory but analysts said the market was not likely to witness a sharp sell-off. Asian stocks steadied, but were on course for a losing week as worries about weak corporate earnings and slowing global economic growth limit the appeal of riskier assets.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Called “Project Shield”, the device - a cross between the controller familiar to most console gamers and a small tablet display - will be sold direct to consumers, an unusual move for a company best known for computer graphics cards and mobile processors. The unveiling late on Sunday took the industry by surprise. Nvidia offered few details beyond basic specifications. Executives said that when it launches, it will be able to run Google Android games now found on smartphones and tablets. It can also stream games from PCs. “Everything you do with your Android device just works here,” Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang told reporters in Las Vegas ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show. “This is the culmination of five years of work.” Nvidia is keeping a tight lid on Project Shield, with only a handful of closely guarded prototypes circulating within the company, a source at Nvidia told Reuters. Huang would not say when the device — or the Tegra 4 that powers it — will begin selling, or at what price. Tablets and smartphones support limited control functions like swiping and tapping. By integrating a controller with a screen, Nvidia may be angling for hardcore gamers who play shooter and other intense action games on consoles. Developers have not yet been successful in bringing such  titles to mobile devices like the Apple iPad, analysts say. “At first glance, this does seem more primed for attacking the mobile and tablet consumer sector rather than impacting the Microsft or Sony HD console experience,” said Jesse Divnich, an analyst at video game research firm EEDAR. Others said Nvidia may be trying to vie for a bigger slice of the console gaming market. Microsoft now uses graphics chips from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc for its Xbox, the market leader. Apart from a growing assortment of game-capable tablets and smartphones, Sony and Microsoft are both expected to release next-generation versions of the PlayStation and Xbox this year. Nvidia’s new device will support the popular game digital download service “Steam”, bringing on board top-selling titles like “Assassin’s Creed” and “Battlefield 3”. “Nvidia has really been a hardware consumer-facing company for nearly 15 years in the graphics card business,” PJ McNealy, CEO of Digital World Research, said. “It’ll be a challenge to leverage that legacy into a broader hardware business.” SHIELD Beyond gaming, entertainment features like Hulu and Netflix have become a unique selling point for Sony’s PlayStation and Microsoft’s Xbox consoles. “Nvidia is many years way from trying to penetrate that market,” Divnich said. With PC sales suffering due to economic uncertainty and a growing consumer preference for tablets, Nvidia has also staked its future on leveraging its graphics expertise to make high-performance processors for mobile devices. The Tegra 4 chip, with four central processing cores, will be Nvidia’s first to include LTE technology for high-speed telecommunication networks. The company has made inroads in tablets but competition from larger rival Qualcomm has some on Wall Street concerned the company may struggle to keep its mobile business growing fast. Qualcomm already offers 4G technology in its chips. Huang said Nvidia’s newest Tegra boasts improved image processing capabilities for digital cameras in phones and tablets. Huang also said the Tegra 4 chip lets tablets load web pages more quickly than devices using rival chips. The previous Tegra 3 is used in Google’s Nexus 7, one of only a handful of tablets to make inroads against Apple’s iPads. The Tegra 3 chip is also used in Microsoft’s  recently launched Surface tablet. At the event, Huang also introduced a cloud product called the Nvidia Grid, a server and software package designed to remotely handle graphics computations for video games instead of on consoles like the Xbox in game-players’ living rooms.

Demand from cloud computing companies have boosted sales of server chips, helping the overall results of AMD and rival Intel Corp. Lenovo, the world’s biggest maker of personal computers, is also a major maker of servers that sit inside data centers and power online services such as gaming and video streaming.  Intel’s Xeon chips have dominated the market for server chips, but AMD has been gaining ground since its re-entry into the business three years ago with rival EPYC processors that earned positive reviews. Lenovo said on Tuesday that the newest server design would accommodate two AMD processor chips inside a single server, making the machines capable of handling more workload. Previously, Lenovo had only offered servers with one AMD chip.

Stocks held gains following the release of minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting. Details of the meeting showed that policymakers were worried over the fate of currently low inflation and saw the recent tax changes as providing a boost to the economy. “It emphasizes the message they’ve had out there, that they’ll be data dependent and that they want to try to normalize policy unless there’s an economic slowdown or inflation doesn’t act as expected,” said Sameer Samana, global equity and technical strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. “It was at least interesting that they tipped their hats to the tax cuts.” Earlier in the session, a report showed U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, in a further sign of strong economic momentum at the end of 2017. Meanwhile, manufacturing surveys pointed to a strong start for the European economy. The technology sector was boosted by a rise in shares of Alphabet, IBM and chipmakers. The S&P 500 tech index - the best-performing S&P 500 sector in 2017 with a 37-percent jump - was up 1 percent. U.S. chipmaker stocks surged for second straight session, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index up 1.4 percent and heading for its strongest two-day performance since July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 48.67 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,872.68, the S&P 500 gained 13.73 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,709.54 and the Nasdaq Composite added 52.86 points, or 0.75 percent, to 7,059.75. Oracle shares were up 2.5 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock. Gains in energy and healthcare also boosted the market. The S&P energy index was up 1.5 percent while S&P healthcare was up 1 percent. Intel fell 6.2 percent following a report that its processor chips had a fundamental design flaw. Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices climbed 9.5 percent. Nvidia gained 6.6 percent and Micron rose 2.8 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

All three major stock indexes closed at all-time highs on Monday, continuing a record-setting spree. President Donald Trump further fanned hopes of a trade truce over the weekend by saying the two sides would sign a Phase 1 deal “very shortly.” Investors were wary at the beginning of the month about the stock market mirroring a slump from December 2018, when trade tensions between the world’s top two economies escalated, marking the worst December on Wall Street since the Great Depression. But the much-awaited breakthrough in negotiations, coupled with indications of a smoother exit for Britain from the European Union, has sent financial markets across the world into record territory this month. “This holiday period should be rather calm as trade updates appear very constructive as we near the finalization of the Phase 1 trade deal next month,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, wrote in a note. The S&P 500 is up nearly 29% so far in 2019 and set for its best year since 2013, also powered by three interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and easing fears of a recession. At 8:45 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 26 points, or 0.09%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 1.5 points, or 0.05% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 6 points, or 0.07%. Volumes are expected to be thin this week as traders settle in for the holidays, with the main U.S. stock exchanges to close at 1 p.m. ET on Tuesday and remain shut on Christmas Day. Among the few individual movers premarket, Advanced Micro Devices Inc rose 1.5% after RBC Capital Markets raised it price target on the chipmaker’s shares on improving data center demand. Boeing Co was indicated slightly higher, a day after the beleaguered planemaker ousted Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg as it grapples with the crisis around its grounded 737 MAX jets.

Stocks added slightly to gains late, with some support from minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting showing the U.S. central bank would likely stick to gradual interest rate hikes this year. “They reiterated gradual rate increases, so that’s steady as she goes, which the stock market seems to like,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.  Earlier in the session, data showed U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, a sign of economic momentum at the end of 2017. Meanwhile, manufacturing surveys pointed to a strong start for the European economy. For technology stocks, Alphabet Inc, IBM and chipmakers were among the biggest drivers.

U.S. chipmaker stocks surged for a second straight session, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index up 1.7 percent in its strongest two-day performance since June 2016. “The (recent) selloff in tech stocks may have made that group look attractive today given that there’s still significant growth potential there both short term and long term,” Hellwig said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 98.67 points, or 0.4 percent, to 24,922.68, the S&P 500 gained 17.25 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,713.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 58.63 points, or 0.84 percent, to 7,065.53.

Gains in energy and healthcare also boosted the market. The S&P energy index gained 1.5 percent while S&P healthcare rose 1 percent. Intel Corp ended down 3.4 percent. The company acknowledged a report that a design flaw in its chips could let hackers steal data but said it was working on a solution that would not significantly slow computers. Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices climbed 5.2 percent. Nvidia Corp gained 6.6 percent and Micron Technology Inc rose 3 percent.

At the end of its two-day policy meeting the Fed said it maintained its interest rate target range until it is confident the economy has weathered the virus and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. “This was pretty much as expected. The key statement will be in September when they give some forward guidance,” said Stan Shipley, Evercore ISI macro research analyst in New York. Wall Street’s major indexes were already higher before the Fed commentary, on the eve of scheduled earnings reports from Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Alphabet’s Google. The chief executives of all four companies also faced a congressional hearing on antitrust issues. “You’ll often see an uptick in those shares ahead of earnings and if they disappoint then they tend to sell off,” said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi Personal Wealth Management. At 2:30 p.m. ET (1830 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 105.68 points, or 0.4%, to 26,484.96, the S&P 500 gained 32.98 points, or 1.02%, to 3,251.42 and the Nasdaq Composite added 124.98 points, or 1.2%, to 10,527.07. All 11 major S&P sectors were higher with financial and technology stocks leading the percentage gainers. Investors were also focused on contentious negotiations in Washington around what should go into government’s next coronavirus relief plan days before enhanced unemployment benefits were set to expire. On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he did not support everything in a Senate Republican proposal but would not elaborate. Advanced Micro Devices Inc shares were up 12.6% after the chipmaker raised its full-year revenue forecast and the Philadelphia chip index rose 2%. Starbucks Corp climbed 4% after the coffee chain said business was “steadily recovering” worldwide and it would report a profit in the current quarter. Of the S&P 500 firms that have reported results, 79.1% have surpassed a low bar of quarterly profit expectations, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Recent data pointed to a possible slowdown in business and hiring as several U.S. states reimposed restrictions after a spike in COVID-19 infections, while deaths in the country caused by the disease surpassed 150,000 on Wednesday. Boeing Co slipped 2.6% as it slashed production on its widebody programs and reported a bigger-than-expected loss due to the fallout from the pandemic. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.92-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 73 new highs and 14 new lows.

The AWS Graviton2 processor, which is estimated to be seven times faster than its previous chip, uses technology from SoftBank Group Corp-owned (9984.T) Arm Holdings.  Reuters reported last week that Amazon was looking to design a data center processor chip to power its cloud unit. Data center processor chips are used in cloud computing, an area that is fast emerging as a big business.

Several companies warned of disruption to their operations due to the virus outbreak, while a Chinese government economist was also quoted as saying the country’s economic growth may drop to 5% or even lower. Starbucks Corp dropped 2.9% after warning of a financial hit as it closed thousands of restaurants and adjusted operating hours in China. American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines Holdings Inc said they were canceling some flights to China, while Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd said its 2020 earnings would be hurt after it canceled three trips of its China-based cruise liner. “The market remains a bit uneasy about the situation in China,” said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. “There’s still a feeling that as good as things have been up till now, you could see problems in China lead to a slowing in the next quarter.” The indexes opened up about 0.4%, but the gains quickly evaporated as shares in AT&T, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Anthem Inc fell following their results.

Investors were also on the sidelines ahead of the Federal Reserve’s statement later in the day from its policy meeting. Interest rates will almost certainly remain on hold. Advanced Micro Devices Inc dropped 7% after the chipmaker forecast first-quarter revenue largely below analysts’ estimates due to waning demand from gaming console makers. AT&T Inc fell 2.4% after it missed fourth-quarter revenue estimates, while Anthem Inc dropped 5.6% after the health insurer missed estimates for medical costs in the fourth quarter.

Advanced Micro Devices Inc jumped 12% after the chipmaker raised its full-year revenue forecast. AMD shares were among the top boosts to the benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. The Philadelphia chip index rose 1.1%. Starbucks Corp climbed 4% after the coffee chain said business was “steadily recovering” worldwide and it would return to profitability in the current quarter. Of the 163 S&P 500 firms that have reported results, 79.1% have surpassed a low bar of quarterly profit expectations, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Recent data pointed to a possible slowdown in business and hiring as infections spiked in southern and western U.S. states, and deaths from the novel coronavirus approached 150,000 in the country on Wednesday. Investors will keep a close watch on how the U.S. central bank addresses these economic risks at the end of a two-day policy meeting. The Fed’s statement is expected at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), which will be followed by Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. Emergency monetary stimulus measures along with trillions of dollars in fiscal support have been pivotal in driving a sharp recovery in the U.S. stock markets since March. “The biggest catalyst within the market right now — for at least the bullish sentiment — is where’s the next wave of liquidity,” said Andrew Smith, chief investment strategist, Delos Capital Advisors, based in Dallas. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday his administration and Democrats in Congress were far apart in their efforts to come together on a coronavirus relief bill, and he suggested he was not in a hurry to strike a deal.

Nvidia Corp jumped 6.4% in premarket trading as it forecast first-quarter revenue that topped analysts’ expectations, reinforcing expectations of a rebound in chip demand. Shares of rival Intel Corp rose 0.6%, while Advanced Micro Devices Inc gained 1.6%. Wall Street is on course for a second straight weekly rise after hitting a series of record highs as a largely positive fourth-quarter earnings season and confidence in the U.S. economy helped investors look past conflicting headlines on the virus. A recent Reuters poll showed the virus-hit Chinese economy will grow at its slowest rate since the financial crisis in the current quarter but the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained. Chinese health authorities reported more than 5,000 new cases on Friday, suggesting that the epidemic was showing no signs of easing. At 7:26 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 29 points, or 0.1%.

Wall Street’s main indexes had closed more than 4% higher on Monday after their worst week since 2008, as central banks in Japan and the European Union joined the Federal Reserve in signaling further monetary easing. But a statement from the meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors on Tuesday only said they stood “ready to take actions, including fiscal measures where appropriate”. “The G7 is essentially trying to reassure markets but it doesn’t have the ability to really impact interest rates directly,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. As of Monday, traders had fully priced in a 50 basis point reduction in borrowing costs from the Fed this month, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, compared with zero just a week ago, as the virus spreads faster outside China. “Frankly, futures are overestimating not just the probability of a cut, but the magnitude of the cut as well,” Frederick said. At 8:51 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 102 points, or 0.39%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 7.5 points, or 0.24% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 50.25 points, or 0.57%. Although futures were trading higher just before the bell, the implied open for Wall Street’s main stock indexes was lower. Healthcare equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific, rose 5% in premarket trading after it launched a $11.6 billion bid for German genetic testing company Qiagen. Department store retailer Kohl’s Corp gained 4.1% after it beat quarterly profit estimates as partnerships with online retail giant Amazon.com and others brought in more shoppers to its stores. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices rose 2.4% after Piper Sandler raised the stock to “overweight” on expectations the company would continue to gain market share from peer Intel over the next several years. Electric-car maker Tesla rose 6.7% after brokerage JMP Securities upgraded the stock to “market perform”. Focus will also be on U.S. politics as 14 states hold primaries on Super Tuesday to choose the Democratic candidate to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 elections.

General Motors Co rose 4.6% premarket after posting a smaller-than-expected loss for the second quarter, helped by pickup truck sales and aggressive cost-cutting. Advanced Micro Devices Inc jumped 11% after the chipmaker raised its full-year revenue forecast, driven in part by an overall surge in chip demand and market-share gains from larger rival Intel Corp. Of the 163 S&P 500 firms that have reported results, 79.1% have surpassed a low bar of quarterly profit expectations, according to Refinitiv IBES data, well above the average of 59% of companies beating profit estimates over the past four quarters.

Chipmakers, which are sensitive to China’s growth, were under pressure, with Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc dropping about 1% each in premarket trade. President Donald Trump has promised action over China’s new national security legislation for Hong Kong by the end of the week. Analysts have warned the souring relations between the world’s two largest economies in recent weeks over trade and the handling of the coronavirus outbreak pose the biggest threat to the stock market’s strong rally off the March lows. The benchmark S&P 500 hit a near three-month high on Wednesday, closing above the key psychological level of 3,000 amid growing evidence of a pick up in business activity. Investors will also focus on Labor Department’s data which is expected to show that more than 2 million Americans sought unemployment benefits for the 10th straight week.

REUTERS/ Mike Blake(Reuters) - Semiconductor firm Nvidia Corp on Thursday announced a new chip that can be digitally split up to run several different programs on one physical chip, a first for the company that matches a key capability on many of Intel Corp’s chips. The notion behind what the Santa Clara, California-based company calls its A100 chip is simple: Help the owners of data centers get every bit of computing power possible out of the physical chips they purchase by ensuring the chip never sits idle. The same principle helped power the rise of cloud computing over the past two decades and helped Intel build a massive data center business. When software developers turn to a cloud computing provider such as Amazon.com or Microsoft Corp for computing power, they do not rent a full physical server inside a data center. Instead they rent a software-based slice of a physical server called a “virtual machine.” Such virtualization technology came about because software developers realized that powerful and pricey servers often ran far below full computing capacity. By slicing physical machines into smaller virtual ones, developers could cram more software on to them, similar to the puzzle game Tetris. Amazon, Microsoft and others built profitable cloud businesses out of wringing every bit of computing power from their hardware and selling that power to millions of customers.  But the technology has been mostly limited to processor chips from Intel and similar chips such as those from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Nvidia said Thursday that its new A100 chip can be split into seven “instances.” For Nvida, that solves a practical problem. Nvidia sells chips for artificial intelligence tasks. The market for those chips breaks into two parts. “Training” requires a powerful chip to, for example, analyze millions of images to train an algorithm to recognize faces. But once the algorithm is trained, “inference” tasks need only a fraction of the computing power to scan a single image and spot a face. Nvidia is hoping the A100 can replace both, being used as a big single chip for training and split into smaller inference chips.  Customers who want to test the theory will pay a steep price of $200,000 for Nvidia’s DGX server built around the A100 chips. In a call with reporters, Chief Executive Jensen Huang argued the math will work in Nvidia’s favor, saying the computing power in the DGX A100 was equal to that of 75 traditional servers that would cost $5,000 each.   “Because it’s fungible, you don’t have to buy all these different types of servers. Utilization will be higher,” he said. “You’ve got 75 times the performance of a $5,000 server, and you don’t have to buy all the cables.” Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Leslie AdlerOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

At least eleven brokerages hiked price targets on the company’s stock. Brokerage Cowen & Company was the most bullish, raising its target by $85 to $325, higher than Wall Street’s median price target of $285.15 and Friday’s pre-market price of around $287.  Analysts at Susquehanna said while they had expected the company to beat market consensus expectations thanks to the data center demand, they had never expected this kind of upside. “Nvidia’s dream-a-dream AI story is solidly back on track,” analysts from the brokerage said in a note to clients.  Chipmakers have had a rollercoaster ride over the past two years, with Donald Trump’s trade war with China and the fading of a boom in mobile phone development and sales eating into growth. New markets in self-driving cars, internet of things appliances and the huge data centers needed to drive booming e-commerce and new online functionality, by contrast, are still developing.  Sales from Nvidia’s data center business, which serves clients developing products related to artificial intelligence, surged 43% in the fourth quarter to $968 million. Jefferies analysts projected a 34% jump overall this year. The chipmaker also forecast first-quarter sales above estimates, even as it expected a $100 million hit from the coronavirus outbreak. The strong forecast also helped fuel expectations of a rebound in chip demand.   “With solid product cycles in Gaming and sustainable strong demand from Data Center customers, we continue to see an upward bias in revenues, margins, and earnings as we move through FY21,” J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a note. Nvidia was the second chipmaker after Qualcomm Inc to warn of the potential impact on its business of the coronavirus outbreak, which has left Chinese companies struggling to restart production after an extended new year holiday. Cowen analysts said Nvidia was also benefiting from pent-up demand following under-investment from cloud customers in the first half of 2019 and accelerating demand for conversational AI - where computers engage in human-like dialogue.

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith (Reuters) - Chip supplier Nvidia Corp on Monday called off the in-person portion of its annual user conference scheduled for March 22 to 26 at the San Jose Convention Center, citing health and safety concerns as the coronavirus spreads in the United States. The company, which supplies chips for artificial intelligence applications and video gaming graphics, said in a blog post it would hold the conference online instead. Chief Executive Jensen Huang will still deliver a keynote address via livestream, the company said.

FILE PHOTO: The nVIDIA booth is shown at the E3 2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2017.  REUTERS/ Mike BlakeThe forecast reinforced expectations of a rebound in chip demand and sent Nvidia shares up nearly 7% in extended trading. Last month, Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O), Nvidia’s primary rivals in selling chips to data centre customers, both forecast positive trends in that market. Nvidia is the second chipmaker after Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) to warn about a potential impact on its businesses due to the coronavirus outbreak. Nvidia’s largest market is chips that enhance the graphics in video games played on PCs and laptops. But in recent years, the company has expanded to sell to data centre and cloud computing customers as its chips increasingly power artificial intelligence tasks such as facial recognition and speech recognition. Revenue from Nvidia’s closely watched data centre chips business rose 42.6% to $968 million in its fiscal fourth quarter, beating analysts’ estimate of $829 million, according to research firm FactSet. Nvidia did not name big customers but said that “hyperscale” customers drove the increased data centre sales, a group that industry analysts often define as major cloud computing vendors such as Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google, Amazon.com’s (AMZN.O) cloud unit and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). Artificial intelligence chips for data centres come in two broad types: “training” chips that ingest data and train a software to carry out tasks like recognising a face, and “inference” chips that use the trained algorithms to carry out the task. Nvidia dominates the market for training chips, while Intel had most of the inference market. But Nvidia executives said the company’s inference revenue grew by a factor of four over the past year, thanks to a new chip. Chief Executive Jensen Huang told Reuters in an interview that inference chips reached a “low double-digits” percentage of Nvidia’s data centre revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter, but training chips also set sales record. “I would expect inference to grow, and I would expect training to grow,” Huang said. The Santa Clara, California-based company said it expects current-quarter revenue of $3 billion, plus or minus 2%, the midpoint of which is above analysts’ expectation of $2.86 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  The company said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China, a major market for both its gaming and data centre chips, was unclear but it has reduced its sales outlook by $100 million in response. In a conference call with investors, Colette Kress, Nvidia’s chief financial officer, said China represented about 30% of sales for Nvidia’s gaming chip business, the company’s largest sales segment. “We had expected a weaker outlook for its April quarter as Nvidia does have a very high gaming GPU sales exposure in China,” said Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights Group. “We believe the continued strength in Nvidia’s data centre business is able to partially offset the demand weakness in its consumer gaming business in China due to the coronavirus outbreak.” Nvidia said it expects its $6.8 billion acquisition of Israeli chip firm Mellanox Technologies Ltd (MLNX.O) will close in the “early part of calendar 2020.” Nvidia still needs approval from Chinese regulators.  Revenue from its gaming business, still the biggest contributor to sales, rose 56% to $1.49 billion in the fourth quarter, but fell short of analysts’ estimate of $1.52 billion, according to FactSet.      Total revenue in the quarter rose about 41% to $3.11 billion, above analysts’ estimate of $2.97 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net income rose to $950 million, or $1.53 per share, in the fiscal fourth-quarter ended Jan. 26, from $567 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned $1.89 per share, above estimates of $1.69.

FILE PHOTO: A rendered image of the NVIDIA Orin chip, which is used for a new platform the company launched on Thursday that can support everything from safety driving technology all the way to self-driving technology for robotaxis, is seen in this undated handout image released to Reuters on May 13, 2020. NVINDIA/Handout via REUTERSThe move, announced as part of the chip company’s annual conference, which was held online this year, represents a change in direction for Nvidia. Until now, the Santa Clara, California-based company has supplied key technology aimed at making autonomous vehicles that require much more sophisticated computers.  But such vehicles, some of which are known as “robo-taxis,” remain years away from mass adoption. Even before the coronavirus pandemic hammered the world economy, automakers such as General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co were dialing down their expectations for self-driving cars. Many of the driver-assistance features that the new Nvidia system will enable, by contrast, are already available on high-end vehicles with technology from providers such as Mobileye, the Israeli firm owned by Nvidia data center rival Intel Corp. Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at Nvidia, said the shift in strategy is aimed at meeting the existing needs of automakers that struggle with maintaining two systems - one for the driver assistance available today, and one for more advanced self-driving technology for the future.     The new Nvidia system means automakers will be able to use one system for both, saving engineering efforts and using some of the self-driving technology to improve the driver assistance functions, Shapiro said. “We have a single architecture that will enable the automaker to span every potential level of automation they want to deliver and put that software-updatable system in every single vehicle,” Shapiro said. Nvidia’s new self-driving technology uses the “Orin” processing chip the company launched in December. Shapiro said he expected vehicles using the system could start production in early 2023.  Shapiro declined to comment on pricing or potential automaker customers. However, he said the Nvidia chips will be part of a larger system that includes cameras and will likely be built by traditional automotive suppliers such as Continental AG, ZF Friedrichshafen AG or Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL].   “We’re the (artificial intelligence) brain that would go into this,” Shapiro said.

FILE PHOTO: A rendered image of the NVIDIA Orin chip, which is used for a new platform the company launched on Thursday that can support everything from safety driving technology all the way to self-driving technology for robotaxis, is seen in this undated handout image released to Reuters on May 13, 2020. NVINDIA/Handout via REUTERSThe move, announced as part of the chip company’s annual conference, which was held online this year, represents a change in direction for Nvidia. Until now, the Santa Clara, California-based company has supplied key technology aimed at making autonomous vehicles that require much more sophisticated computers.  But such vehicles, some of which are known as “robo-taxis,” remain years away from mass adoption. Even before the coronavirus pandemic hammered the world economy, automakers such as General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co were dialing down their expectations for self-driving cars. Many of the driver-assistance features that the new Nvidia system will enable, by contrast, are already available on high-end vehicles with technology from providers such as Mobileye, the Israeli firm owned by Nvidia data center rival Intel Corp. Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at Nvidia, said the shift in strategy is aimed at meeting the existing needs of automakers that struggle with maintaining two systems - one for the driver assistance available today, and one for more advanced self-driving technology for the future.     The new Nvidia system means automakers will be able to use one system for both, saving engineering efforts and using some of the self-driving technology to improve the driver assistance functions, Shapiro said. “We have a single architecture that will enable the automaker to span every potential level of automation they want to deliver and put that software-updatable system in every single vehicle,” Shapiro said. Nvidia’s new self-driving technology uses the “Orin” processing chip the company launched in December. Shapiro said he expected vehicles using the system could start production in early 2023.  Shapiro declined to comment on pricing or potential automaker customers. However, he said the Nvidia chips will be part of a larger system that includes cameras and will likely be built by traditional automotive suppliers such as Continental AG, ZF Friedrichshafen AG or Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL].   “We’re the (artificial intelligence) brain that would go into this,” Shapiro said.

The platform virtually uses a GeForce graphics card to power personal computers, android phones and Shield TVs, enabling the devices to run games with enhanced graphics.  GeForce NOW, previously available on a public beta version, will offer a Founders version at $4.99 per month alongside a free tier. Google Stadia offers a 4K version as part of its premium service priced at $9.99 per month, while the free high-definition version is expected to roll out this year.    Stadia has been downloaded nearly 593,000 times since its launch in November, according to data from industry site Sensor Tower. GeForce NOW will also compete with Microsoft Corp’s Project xCloud, which is likely to be launched this year. The cloud gaming market is expected to expand to $8 billion by 2025 from $1 billion in 2018, according to data from Statista. Analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy expects the cloud gaming market to grow exponentially over the next five years as giants like Alphabet Inc’s Google, Microsoft and Nvidia enter the market with acceptable experiences. GeForce NOW has over 30 free-to-play games and users can also add games previously owned, while Stadia’s premium version  launched with a slate of 22 games.

The alliance between a deep-pocketed tech player and the world’s oldest carmaker allows Mercedes to jointly develop new automated driving capabilities and software applications at a time when the auto industry is struggling to generate profits. “We want to launch a ground-breaking software-defined computer architecture for driving assistance and autonomous drive,” Daimler Chief Executive Ola Kaellenius said during a joint presentation by the two companies on Tuesday. The Nvidia Drive AGX Orin Platform, an autonomous vehicle processor, will be rolled out starting in 2024, allowing Mercedes to update a car’s software the same way that smartphones are updated today. “Every future Mercedes-Benz with the NVIDIA DRIVE system will come with a team of expert AI and software engineers continuously developing, refining and enhancing the car over its lifetime,” Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said. The companies will jointly develop the artificial intelligence (AI) and automated vehicle applications to enable higher levels of automated driving, Daimler said. The new partnership follows Daimler’s move last week to pause a development alliance with rival German luxury carmaker BMW in automated driving.

Mellanox shares rose nearly 2% in afternoon trading, while Nvidia jumped about 4%. Many acquisitions between U.S. and international companies with significant operations in China have faced challenges in securing approval from the country’s regulator due to a bitter trade war between the two largest economies of the world that started in January, 2018.  Two years ago, U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc had to walk away from a $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors after failing to secure Chinese regulatory approval. Nvidia, known for its powerful gaming graphics chips, wants to bolster its data center and artificial intelligence business through the Mellanox takeover, its biggest deal, to better compete with rival Intel. U.S. and EU antitrust authorities have already given their approval for the deal, which is expected to close before April 27, 2020.

REUTERS/Mike Blake(Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia Corp on Tuesday opened up for membership its cloud-based game streaming service GeForce NOW, taking on Google’s Stadia in a market that is primed for high growth over the next few years.  The platform virtually uses a GeForce graphics card to power personal computers, android phones and Shield TVs, enabling the devices to run games with enhanced graphics.  GeForce NOW, previously available on a public beta version, will offer a Founders version at $4.99 per month alongside a free tier. Google Stadia offers a 4K version as part of its premium service priced at $9.99 per month, while the free high-definition version is expected to roll out this year.    Stadia has been downloaded nearly 593,000 times since its launch in November, according to data from industry site Sensor Tower. GeForce NOW will also compete with Microsoft Corp’s Project xCloud, which is likely to be launched this year. The cloud gaming market is expected to expand to $8 billion by 2025 from $1 billion in 2018, according to data from Statista. Analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy expects the cloud gaming market to grow exponentially over the next five years as giants like Alphabet Inc’s Google, Microsoft and Nvidia enter the market with acceptable experiences. GeForce NOW has over 30 free-to-play games and users can also add games previously owned, while Stadia’s premium version  launched with a slate of 22 games.    Users who opt for Nvidia’s Founders version will have access to games which support ray tracing, or the ability to simulate how light rays will bounce around in a visual scene, making the visuals more realistic.

REUTERS/Yves Herman/Files(Reuters) - Semiconductor maker Nvidia Corp said on Tuesday it struck a deal with Germany’s Daimler Mercedes-Benz to provide cars produced from 2024 with a chip and software platform that can eventually be used for autonomous driving functions. “We intend to join forces to create a software-defined vehicle and deploy this across the entire next generation’s fleet,” Nvidia Senior Director of Automotive Danny Shapiro told reporters.  Shapiro declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal. The deal covers chips and software for the vehicle system. The new partnership followed Daimler’s move last week to pause a development alliance with rival German luxury carmaker BMW in the area of automated driving. Shapiro said the high-end Nvidia Drive AGX Orin Platform - an autonomous vehicle processor - would be standard in every Mercedes-Benz vehicle. With that in place, consumers will be able to update the car’s software the way smartphones are updated today. Asked how the Mercedes-Benz partnership will affect Nvidia’s decade-long collaboration with Audi AG, Shapiro said neither arrangement was exclusive. With Mercedes-Benz there is “a huge dedication, huge energy, huge investment from both companies to bring this to market,” he said. Mercedes-Benz sold 2.39 million cars worldwide in 2019. The two companies have been working together on autonomous driving and artificial intelligence car technology for over five years.

FILE PHOTO: The Mercedes-Benz logo is seen on a car in front of the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany February 11, 2020. REUTERS/Andreas Gebert/File PhotoDaimler and Nvidia unveiled a deal on Tuesday to develop and equip the German company’s Mercedes-Benz cars with a next-generation chip and software platform that could eventually be used to help vehicles drive by themselves.  The move is a response to Tesla’s ability to integrate custom designed chips with thousands of lines of code, which has allowed the Silicon Valley-based company to develop new features faster than its competitors.     While Daimler and German rivals Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and BMW have criticised Tesla’s aggressive marketing of its “autopilot” features, they have struggled to match the speed with which the U.S. carmaker brings innovations to market.  Thanks to instantly upgradeable software, Tesla’s cars boast a longer operating range and more entertainment options than rivals, even as it struggles to ramp up production. According to Volkswagen, Tesla is a decade ahead of the competition. In a bid to narrow the gap, Mercedes, the world’s oldest carmaker, has taken the unprecedented step of sharing its intellectual property with an outside tech company in exchange for access to Nvidia’s computer processors and its software engineers specialised in artificial intelligence. That’s a big change from established automakers’ traditional approach of trying to go it alone, or partnering with existing suppliers and manufacturers, and marks an attempt to keep up with Tesla, and deep-pocketed tech firms like Amazon and Apple. Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi have so far used a patchwork approach, combining vehicle platforms originally designed for combustion engine drives with electric vehicle software and components largely developed by third party suppliers. Rather than designing a new vehicle from the ground up, German carmakers have attempted to stitch together software from suppliers of camera and radar sensors, which has made it harder to upgrade their vehicles than if they had used a comprehensive, upgradeable vehicle operating system.  Software and processing power is gaining in importance thanks to automated driving, which requires radar, ultrasonic, camera and lidar sensors to talk to each other as well as to manage competing demands for battery power. With zero-emission cars, electricity is not just consumed through acceleration, but also by cooling the battery, running air conditioners, seat heaters, in-car infotainment, image recognition and semi-autonomous driving functions.  CATCHING UP  Although Tesla started out with a similar patchwork approach, it has since adopted a strategy akin to Apple with its iPhone - it now designs computer chips and software in-house. Like Apple, Tesla has redefined the way technologies are packaged, leaving analysts wondering whether the car sector will follow the phone industry, where profits moved from device manufacturer to producers of high-tech components and software.      Spooked by Tesla’s advance, German carmakers and major supplier Robert Bosch are retooling their businesses to accommodate “software first” operating systems, which rely on fewer, more powerful chips and computers.  But they face a battle to catch up.  Traditional carmakers have struggled to attract software engineering talent, in part because of a reticence to pay big salaries for projects without a defined business case, allowing Tesla to sustain an advantage which some analysts say is getting bigger thanks to the company’s “fleet learning.”  Tesla collects data about battery depletion rates and driving styles from all its cars, and uses this to design new software algorithms.     Prioritising energy consumption has allowed Tesla keep battery capacity above 90% even after 200,000-300,000 kilometres, or four to five years, UBS analysts said in a March 2019 report, attributing this to Tesla-designed software, batteries and semiconductors. Teaming up with Nvidia could allow Daimler to take a short cut to state-of-the-art technology.  The results won’t be immediate - jointly developed Mercedes-Nvidia vehicles are not expected to hit the road until 2024. Nvidia will help Daimler develop assisted and self-driving functions, which will form part of a Mercedes-designed overall vehicle system. Chips and processors will only become more critical as automakers race to build self-driving cars. Just one video sensor, such as Bosch’s stereo video camera, generates 100 gigabytes of data in only one kilometre of travel, making efficient processing vital to optimising vehicle range and training vehicle reflexes.  That makes fewer, more powerful processors a must, according to Harry Kroeger, a former head of development of electronics at Daimler, a former director of Tesla and now a management board member at Bosch overseeing automotive electronics.    “You no longer install one small box for every single function; instead you install a bigger smart box that can do many things simultaneously,” he said.     “The computing power you need for climate control is ridiculously low compared to functions that prevent the car from crashing.

The logo of technology company Nvidia is seen at its headquarters in Santa Clara, California February 11, 2015. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File Photo  Nvidia told reporters that e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and search engine provider Baidu Inc have started using its chips to run systems that make recommendations to users with the aim of increasing the number of times users click on those recommendations. Nvidia also said ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing has adopted its chips both for developing self-driving cars on the road as well as in its back-end data centers. The Santa Clara, California-based chip supplier plans to officially announce the deals at an event on Wednesday in the Chinese city of Suzhou northwest of Shanghai. Nvidia got its start supplying chips to improve videogame graphics on personal computers, but in recent years much of its growth has come from the use of its chips for artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and other new areas. Making recommendations - whether on a restaurant or product that a user might like - has long been a challenging artificial intelligence problem. In a Wednesday press release, Alibaba officials said click-through rates improved by about 10% using Nvidia’s chips. “The problem of recommendation is related to the explosion of choice,” Paresh Kharya, Nvidia’s director of product management for accelerated computing, told reporters at a briefing ahead of Nvidia’s event. “To recommend the right product to the right user at the right time, you need to model the user’s preferences and it takes a lot of different variables to model user preferences. Nvidia also said Didi would use its chips in computing systems in autonomous cars on the road that help drive the vehicles, as well as in back-end data centers where data gathered by test vehicles is used to train algorithms for self-driving cars. At its event, Nvidia also plans to announce tools that will let participating car makers from Germany, China and North America learn from each others’ training data without having to share data directly - a system called “federated” learning. “This is a way to aggregate different types of data sets form different companies,” Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at Nvidia, said at the briefing. “The key thing here is that each (carmaker) or each region can maintain and protect their own data.

FILE PHOTO: The Mercedes-Benz logo is seen on a car in front of the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, Germany February 11, 2020. REUTERS/Andreas Gebert/File PhotoDaimler and Nvidia unveiled a deal on Tuesday to develop and equip the German company’s Mercedes-Benz cars with a next-generation chip and software platform that could eventually be used to help vehicles drive by themselves.  The move is a response to Tesla’s ability to integrate custom designed chips with thousands of lines of code, which has allowed the Silicon Valley-based company to develop new features faster than its competitors.     While Daimler and German rivals Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and BMW have criticised Tesla’s aggressive marketing of its “autopilot” features, they have struggled to match the speed with which the U.S. carmaker brings innovations to market.  Thanks to instantly upgradeable software, Tesla’s cars boast a longer operating range and more entertainment options than rivals, even as it struggles to ramp up production. According to Volkswagen, Tesla is a decade ahead of the competition. In a bid to narrow the gap, Mercedes, the world’s oldest carmaker, has taken the unprecedented step of sharing its intellectual property with an outside tech company in exchange for access to Nvidia’s computer processors and its software engineers specialised in artificial intelligence. That’s a big change from established automakers’ traditional approach of trying to go it alone, or partnering with existing suppliers and manufacturers, and marks an attempt to keep up with Tesla, and deep-pocketed tech firms like Amazon and Apple. Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi have so far used a patchwork approach, combining vehicle platforms originally designed for combustion engine drives with electric vehicle software and components largely developed by third party suppliers. Rather than designing a new vehicle from the ground up, German carmakers have attempted to stitch together software from suppliers of camera and radar sensors, which has made it harder to upgrade their vehicles than if they had used a comprehensive, upgradeable vehicle operating system.  Software and processing power is gaining in importance thanks to automated driving, which requires radar, ultrasonic, camera and lidar sensors to talk to each other as well as to manage competing demands for battery power. With zero-emission cars, electricity is not just consumed through acceleration, but also by cooling the battery, running air conditioners, seat heaters, in-car infotainment, image recognition and semi-autonomous driving functions.  CATCHING UP  Although Tesla started out with a similar patchwork approach, it has since adopted a strategy akin to Apple with its iPhone - it now designs computer chips and software in-house. Like Apple, Tesla has redefined the way technologies are packaged, leaving analysts wondering whether the car sector will follow the phone industry, where profits moved from device manufacturer to producers of high-tech components and software.      Spooked by Tesla’s advance, German carmakers and major supplier Robert Bosch are retooling their businesses to accommodate “software first” operating systems, which rely on fewer, more powerful chips and computers.  But they face a battle to catch up.  Traditional carmakers have struggled to attract software engineering talent, in part because of a reticence to pay big salaries for projects without a defined business case, allowing Tesla to sustain an advantage which some analysts say is getting bigger thanks to the company’s “fleet learning.”  Tesla collects data about battery depletion rates and driving styles from all its cars, and uses this to design new software algorithms.     Prioritising energy consumption has allowed Tesla keep battery capacity above 90% even after 200,000-300,000 kilometres, or four to five years, UBS analysts said in a March 2019 report, attributing this to Tesla-designed software, batteries and semiconductors. Teaming up with Nvidia could allow Daimler to take a short cut to state-of-the-art technology.  The results won’t be immediate - jointly developed Mercedes-Nvidia vehicles are not expected to hit the road until 2024. Nvidia will help Daimler develop assisted and self-driving functions, which will form part of a Mercedes-designed overall vehicle system. Chips and processors will only become more critical as automakers race to build self-driving cars. Just one video sensor, such as Bosch’s stereo video camera, generates 100 gigabytes of data in only one kilometre of travel, making efficient processing vital to optimising vehicle range and training vehicle reflexes.  That makes fewer, more powerful processors a must, according to Harry Kroeger, a former head of development of electronics at Daimler, a former director of Tesla and now a management board member at Bosch overseeing automotive electronics.    “You no longer install one small box for every single function; instead you install a bigger smart box that can do many things simultaneously,” he said.     “The computing power you need for climate control is ridiculously low compared to functions that prevent the car from crashing.

REUTERS/Mike BlakeThe company’s gaming chip business powered the quarterly results, but it said it expects the biggest revenue generating unit to be impacted in the fourth quarter by seasonal weakness for gaming cards used in personal computers and laptops. The strong quarterly performance by the top chipmakers comes as a relief to the industry that is reeling under slowing demand due to a prolonged U.S.-China trade war. Nvidia said it expects data center growth to come from a rise in conversational AI, the ability for computers to engage in human-like dialogue, and inference, the process of using an algorithm for tasks such as translating audio into text-based requests.  “Like Intel, Nvidia saw big demand from its hyperscale customers, undoubtedly driven by machine learning training and inference needs,” Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy said. The company in March outbid Intel to buy Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies Ltd (MLNX.O) for $6.8 billion, in a deal that is expected to help the firm boost its data center and AI business. It will return to buying back stock after closing the acquisition, which it expects in the early part of next year, Nvidia said on Thursday.

FILE PHOTO: The nVIDIA booth is shown at the E3 2017 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2017.  REUTERS/ Mike BlakeThe company said the forecast includes a contribution from its $6.9 billion purchase of Israeli chip firm Mellanox Technologies Ltd, which strengthened its data center business. The chipmaker said it expects current quarter revenue of $3.65 billion, plus or minus 2%, while analysts on average were expecting $3.29 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.     Shares rose 0.4% in after-hours trading after the results were announced. Much like rivals Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O), Nvidia recorded a jump in demand for data center chips as companies invested to strengthen their IT infrastructure to support employees working remotely. Nvidia also said that sales to cloud computing companies drove its data center results. Revenue rose 39% to $3.08 billion in the first quarter ended April 26, with the data center business recording its first $1 billion quarter, the company said. Nvidia’s data center business hit $1.14 billion, up 80 percent from a year earlier. The segment beat analyst estimates of $1.07 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Nvidia’s data center chips power functions such as search suggestions, product recommendations and artificial intelligence work such as speech and image recognition. But some of Nvidia’s market segments were hurt by the pandemic. The company expects sales to automotive customers to fall 40% next quarter. But Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in an interview that some of those companies were also investing in robotics for the future, with Nvidia supplying the chips. “The manufacturing companies are impacted, but they’re racing to work on robotics technology so they can be less impacted in the future,” Huang told Reuters. Nvidia’s net income rose to $917 million, or $1.47 per share, from $394 million, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier.

REUTERS/Mike Blake(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp said on Wednesday its chips used to power artificial intelligence topped a series of benchmark tests that measure a key performance metric in the industry.  The results are a boost to the company’s efforts to make headway into one of the biggest growth areas in the field called  inference, which is the process of using an AI algorithm for tasks such as translating audio into text-based requests. Intel Corp’s processors currently dominate the market for machine learning inference, which analysts at Morningstar estimate to be worth $11.8 billion by 2021.      However, Nvidia dominates the AI training chip market, where huge amounts of data help algorithms “learn” a task such as how to recognize a human voice.  The company said its inference chips have now achieved the fastest results on five new independent suite of AI benchmarks, called MLPerf Inference 0.5. The company on Wednesday also unveiled Jetson Xavier NX, a new chip designed for AI computer, which is the size of a credit card. The chip can be used in devices, including small commercial robots, drones and portable medical devices, that require more computing power without sacrificing size or weight, Nvidia said.  Priced at $399, the new chip will be available in March.

Mellanox shares rose nearly 2% in afternoon trading, while Nvidia jumped about 4%. Many acquisitions between U.S. and international companies with significant operations in China have faced challenges in securing approval from the country’s regulator due to a bitter trade war between the two largest economies of the world that started in January, 2018.  Two years ago, U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc had to walk away from a $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors after failing to secure Chinese regulatory approval. Nvidia, known for its powerful gaming graphics chips, wants to bolster its data center and artificial intelligence business through the Mellanox takeover, its biggest deal, to better compete with rival Intel. U.S. and EU antitrust authorities have already given their approval for the deal, which is expected to close before April 27, 2020.

REUTERS/Mike Blake(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp said on Wednesday its chips used to power artificial intelligence topped a series of benchmark tests that measure a key performance metric in the industry.  The results are a boost to the company’s efforts to make headway into one of the biggest growth areas in the field called  inference, which is the process of using an AI algorithm for tasks such as translating audio into text-based requests. Intel Corp’s processors currently dominate the market for machine learning inference, which analysts at Morningstar estimate to be worth $11.8 billion by 2021.      However, Nvidia dominates the AI training chip market, where huge amounts of data help algorithms “learn” a task such as how to recognize a human voice.  The company said its inference chips have now achieved the fastest results on five new independent suite of AI benchmarks, called MLPerf Inference 0.5. The company on Wednesday also unveiled Jetson Xavier NX, a new chip designed for AI computer, which is the size of a credit card. The chip can be used in devices, including small commercial robots, drones and portable medical devices, that require more computing power without sacrificing size or weight, Nvidia said.  Priced at $399, the new chip will be available in March.

REUTERS/Mike Blake(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp's chip company Arm Holdings Ltd has gathered takeover interest from Nvidia Corp, Bloomberg News reported bloom.bg/30R4Kh5 on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Nvidia and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Arm declined to comment on the report. SoftBank, which acquired Arm for $32 billion in 2016, is exploring options including a full or partial sale or a public offering of the British chip designer, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. The Japanese conglomerate had recently approached Apple Inc to gauge its interest but the latter is not planning to pursue a bid, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Arm’s licensing operation would fit poorly with Apple’s hardware and software focused business model and there may also be regulatory concerns about Apple owning a key licensee that supplies so many rivals, according to the report. Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment. SoftBank last month unveiled a series of transactions to divest more than $21 billion worth of stock in U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc, as it seeks funding for a $41 billion share buyback and debt reduction plan.

REUTERS/Mike BlakeIn a semiconductor industry milestone, Nvidia’s shares rose 2.3% in afternoon trading on Wednesday to a record $404, putting the graphic component maker’s market capitalization at $248 billion, just above the $246 billion value of Intel, once the world’s leading chipmaker. For a graphic on Nvidia’s stock market value eclipses Intel: here Nvidia’s stock has been among Wall Street’s strongest performers in recent years as it expanded from its core personal computer chip business into datacenters, automobiles and artificial intelligence. Intel, which for decades has dominated in processors for PCs and servers, has struggled to diversify its business after making critical stumbles in the smartphone revolution.  U.S. chipmakers have mostly outperformed since the S&P 500 hit a low on March 23, but Intel has enjoyed much less of that rebound than Nvidia, which is frequently among the most traded stocks on Fidelity and other retail investing websites.  While Intel’s stock has lost almost 3% in 2020, Nvidia’s has surged 68%. Investors have been betting that the shift to working remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic will continue to fuel fast growth in Nvidia’s datacenter business. In recent years, Intel has also faced greater competition from foreign competitors, and its market capitalization has already fallen below those of South Korea’s Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW).  Most recently, Intel has suffered setbacks in its sprawling supply chain due to the pandemic, and higher costs related to the development of upcoming “Tiger Lake” 10-nanometer processors. Despite Nvidia’s meteoric stock rise, its sales remain a fraction of Intel’s. Analysts on average see Nvidia’s revenue rising 34% in its current fiscal year to $14.6 billion, while analysts expect Intel’s 2020 revenue to increase 2.5% to $73.8 billion, according to Refinitiv.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu(Reuters) - Chip supplier Nvidia Corp on Monday said it was teaming up with VMware Inc and Amazon.com Inc’s cloud division to court large businesses looking to host artificial intelligence programs in Amazon’s cloud. Nvidia got its start with chips to make computer games more realistic, but in recent years has shifted to supplying chips that speed up artificial intelligence tasks, such as teaching computers to recognize images. Once the domain of Silicon Valley tech firms, artificial intelligence technology is filtering to mainstream businesses that use it for tasks like seeking unseen patterns in their financials to help with forecasting and cost controls. Many of those mainstream businesses use software made by VMware to help shuffle computing work back and forth between their own data centers and cloud data centers owned by Amazon Web Services, depending on where the cost is best. But that has been difficult to do with computer programs that rely on Nvidia chips for a speed boost.

REUTERS/Matthew Tostevin(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Monday it will use chipmaker Nvidia Corp’s (NVDA.O) real-time ray tracing technology to provide the software company’s Minecraft video game players more realistic graphics on personal computers. Real-time ray tracing, or the ability for the chip to simulate how light rays will bounce around in a visual scene, helps video games and other computer graphics more closely resemble shadows and reflections in the real world. Last week, Nvidia posted quarterly results ahead of Wall Street targets and said its profitability was getting a boost from new high-end graphics chips for video gamers. “I think we’ve put all of the pieces in place to bring ray tracing into the future of games. The number of blockbuster games that have adopted RTX is really snowballing,” Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jen-Hsun Huang said on a post-earnings call. Other games which would have the same graphic technology are Activision Blizzard’s (ATVI.O) “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare”, Ubisoft Toronto’s “Watch Dogs: Legion” and Tencent NExT Studios’ “Synced: Off Planet”, Nvidia said on Monday. Minecraft, a construction game in which players can build nearly anything imaginable, block by block, in a digital, Lego-like world, spread like wildfire since its full release in 2011 by developer Mojang, which was bought by Microsoft in 2014. In May this year, Microsoft said 176 million versions of the game have been sold since its launch.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Nvidia Corporation is seen during the annual Computex computer exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan May 30, 2017. REUTERS/Tyrone SiuRevenue fell 17% in the fiscal second quarter ended July 28 and net income fell by half from a year earlier, but results improved from the previous three months. Chief Executive Jensen Huang said gaming laptops able to handle sophisticated games and artificial intelligence models able to handle real-time chat bots were driving demand. The new video game chips use so-called ray tracing technology, which creates pictures by calculating how light hits objects, and students returning to school are buying laptops with the high-end silicon. “Essentially our business is normalized,” Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said, forecasting improving profit margins due to sales of the high-end gaming chips. The previous fiscal year set a sales record but came to what Huang at the time called a “disappointing finish” due to a slowdown in China and a bust in the market for crypto mining chips. The results come against the backdrop of a slowing industry, with research firm Gartner forecasting a 9.6% drop in global semiconductor revenue in 2019. U.S.-China trade tensions, including tariffs on some products, are pressuring chipmakers. The graphics chip maker also said it would resume share buybacks after completing the acquisition of networking products maker Mellanox this year. Nvidia is known for its graphics chips that power video games, but it has developed other markets including artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and data centres. Total revenue in the second quarter fell 17% to $2.58 billion but topped Wall Street targets of $2.55 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue was up 16% from the previous quarter. Revenue in the video gaming business fell 27% to $1.31 billion and beat analysts’ estimate of $1.28 billion, based on an average of five analysts. Sales at the automotive unit rose 30% to $209 million in the quarter. Analysts expected $175 million.  Data centre revenue, which has been an area of concern, fell 14% to $655 million, just behind the $671 million consensus. The company said it expects third-quarter revenue of $2.9 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $2.97 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The third-quarter revenue outlook set on Thursday was a touch behind expectations, but “somewhat better than feared in the current macro environment” analyst Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights Group said in an email. Quarter-on-quarter growth in gaming and autos gave investors some comfort about the medium to long term, Chan said. It reported second-quarter adjusted gross margin of 60.1%, above expectations of 59.5%. It forecast third-quarter margin of 62.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, versus expectations of 60.4%, according to IBES.  Nvidia’s net income fell 50% to $552 million, or 90 cents per share, in the fiscal second-quarter. Excluding items, it earned $1.24 per share, ahead of expectations of $1.15.

REUTERS/Tyrone SiuRevenue fell 17% in the fiscal second quarter ended July 28 and net income fell by half from a year earlier, but results improved from the previous three months. Chief Executive Jensen Huang said gaming laptops able to handle sophisticated games and artificial intelligence models able to handle real-time chat bots were driving demand. The new video game chips use so-called ray tracing technology, which creates pictures by calculating how light hits objects, and students returning to school are buying laptops with the high-end silicon. “Essentially our business is normalized,” Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said, forecasting improving profit margins due to sales of the high-end gaming chips. The previous fiscal year set a sales record but came to what Huang at the time called a “disappointing finish” due to a slowdown in China and a bust in the market for crypto mining chips. The results come against the backdrop of a slowing industry, with research firm Gartner forecasting a 9.6% drop in global semiconductor revenue in 2019. U.S.-China trade tensions, including tariffs on some products, are pressuring chipmakers. The graphics chip maker also said it would resume share buybacks after completing the acquisition of networking products maker Mellanox this year. Nvidia is known for its graphics chips that power video games, but it has developed other markets including artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and data centres. Total revenue in the second quarter fell 17% to $2.58 billion but topped Wall Street targets of $2.55 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue was up 16% from the previous quarter.

Nvidia Corp jumped 8% as the company forecast first-quarter revenue ahead of analysts’ estimates, reinforcing expectations of a rebound in chip demand. Its shares lifted the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index by 0.3%, while the broader technology rose 0.5%. Meanwhile, the coronavirus epidemic in China showed no signs of easing, with health authorities reporting on Friday more than 5,000 new cases. A recent Reuters poll showed the world’s second-biggest economy will grow at its slowest pace since the financial crisis in the current quarter but the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained. “This seems to be a teflon market, where any negativity - whether it is coronavirus or anything - for now continues to get shrugged off,” said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. Economic data continues to be good enough to sustain the market’s uptrend, he added. Wall Street was on course for a second straight weekly gain after hitting a series of record highs on a largely positive fourth-quarter earnings season and confidence in the U.S. economy. However, data released on Friday was not so rosy. A Commerce Department retail sales report showed consumer spending likely slowed further in January, while separate data indicated industrial production fell more than expected last month. At 11:44 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.36 points, or 0.01%, at 29,420.95. The S&P 500 was up 4.78 points, or 0.14%, at 3,378.72 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 25.48 points, or 0.26%, at 9,737.45. The fourth-quarter earnings season is approaching the final lap. About 71% of the 378 S&P 500 firms that have reported so far have topped earnings estimates, according to IBES by Refinitiv. Expedia Inc jumped 11.3% after the online travel services company forecast strong quarterly core earnings amid coronavirus uncertainties. The energy, healthcare and industrial sectors were the losers among the 11 major S&P sectors. U.S. financial markets are closed on Monday for President’s Day. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.17-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.02-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 59 new 52-week highs and two new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 110 new highs and 41 new lows.

Uncertainties surrounding the coronavirus epidemic and downbeat economic data had put a damper on investor sentiment for much of the day. But a CNBC report that the Trump administration could introduce a tax incentive for people earning less than $200,000 to invest up to $10,000 in U.S. stocks gave the markets a late boost. “In an election year, especially when the president is getting backlash that the tax cut benefits only the rich, seeking a way to democratize the stock market to low income earners would be a popular maneuver,” said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta.   While the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed modestly higher, the Dow lost ground. The three major stock averages headed into the U.S. holiday weekend having posted their second consecutive weekly advances. The coronavirus, now called Covid-19, has taken 1,380 lives and infected 63,851 people, according to Chinese authorities. In a recent Reuters survey of 40 economists, the respondents see China’s economy in the current quarter suffering its slowest growth since the financial crisis, but believe the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained. “The true economic implications of the coronavirus are still unknown,” Sroka said, adding “at the end of the day, earnings matter more for the sustainability of stocks than near-term headlines.”  Indeed, of the 387 companies in the S&P 500 having reported fourth-quarter results, 77.4% have surprised Wall Street expectations to the upside, according to Refinitiv data. Analysts now see fourth-quarter earnings rising at an annual pace of 2.6%, a striking reversal of the 0.3% decline seen on Jan 1.

Adding to the downbeat sentiment were a Commerce Department retail sales report showing consumer spending likely slowed further in January and data indicating industrial production fell more than expected last month.

Uncertainties surrounding the coronavirus epidemic and downbeat economic data had put a damper on investor sentiment for much of the day. But a CNBC report that the Trump administration could introduce a tax incentive for people earning less than $200,000 to invest up to $10,000 in U.S. stocks gave the markets a late boost. “In an election year, especially when the president is getting backlash that the tax cut benefits only the rich, seeking a way to democratize the stock market to low income earners would be a popular maneuver,” said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta.   While the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed modestly higher, the Dow lost ground. The three major stock averages headed into the U.S. holiday weekend having posted their second consecutive weekly advances. The coronavirus, now called Covid-19, has taken 1,380 lives and infected 63,851 people, according to Chinese authorities. In a recent Reuters survey of 40 economists, the respondents see China’s economy in the current quarter suffering its slowest growth since the financial crisis, but believe the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained. “The true economic implications of the coronavirus are still unknown,” Sroka said, adding “at the end of the day, earnings matter more for the sustainability of stocks than near-term headlines.”  Indeed, of the 387 companies in the S&P 500 having reported fourth-quarter results, 77.4% have surprised Wall Street expectations to the upside, according to Refinitiv data. Analysts now see fourth-quarter earnings rising at an annual pace of 2.6%, a striking reversal of the 0.3% decline seen on Jan 1.

A NVIDIA logo is shown at SIGGRAPH 2017 in Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 31, 2017.  REUTERS/Mike Blake/FilesNvidia was long known as a supplier of graphics chips for personal computers to make video games look more realistic, but researchers now also use its chips inside data centers to speed up artificial intelligence computing work such as training computers to recognize images.  To do so, Nvidia’s so-called accelerator chips work alongside central processors from companies such as Intel Corp and International Business Machines Corp. At a supercomputing conference held in Germany on Monday, Nvidia said its accelerator chips will work with Arm processors by the end of the year.  Arm, owned by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, provides the underlying processor technology for the chips in most mobile phones. But companies such as Ampere Computing, headed by Intel’s former president, have been working to take those chips into data centers, where Intel’s chips are dominant. But Arm processors are different from Intel or IBM chips in that Arm itself does not make chips. Instead it licenses out the underlying technology so others can make chips with it.  Ian Buck, vice president of Nvidia’s accelerated computing unit, said the project to build a supercomputer with Arm will be a “heavy lift” from a technical perspective. But he said Nvidia undertook it because researchers in Europe and Japan want to develop super computing chips with Arm’s technology, essentially giving them a third option beyond IBM and Intel over which they can have more control. “That openness ... makes it very attractive,” Buck said of Arm’s technology during an interview with Reuters before the conference. “What makes Arm interesting, and why we’re announcing support is, is its ability to provide an open architecture for supercomputing.” The move to work with Arm on supercomputers follows Nvidia’s $6.8 billion deal to buy Israeli firm Mellanox Technologies. Mellanox makes high-speed networking chips that help stitch together many smaller computers into a larger one and is found in some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers.

Ian Buck, vice president of Nvidia’s accelerated computing unit, said the project to build a supercomputer with Arm will be a “heavy lift” from a technical perspective. But he said Nvidia undertook it because researchers in Europe and Japan want to develop super computing chips with Arm’s technology, essentially giving them a third option beyond IBM and Intel over which they can have more control. “That openness ... makes it very attractive,” Buck said of Arm’s technology during an interview with Reuters before the conference. “What makes Arm interesting, and why we’re announcing support is, is its ability to provide an open architecture for supercomputing.” The move to work with Arm on supercomputers follows Nvidia’s $6.8 billion deal to buy Israeli firm Mellanox Technologies. Mellanox makes high-speed networking chips that help stitch together many smaller computers into a larger one and is found in some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers.

The agreement between Volvo and Nvidia is a long-term partnership spanning several years, and work will begin immediately with personnel from the two companies being co-located in Gothenburg, Sweden and Santa Clara, California. Volvo said the partnership will focus on the development of a flexible, scalable autonomous driving system, which is planned to be used first in commercial pilot schemes before it is deployed in commercial vehicles from the Volvo Group, Volvo said. “Utilizing Nvidia’s end-to-end artificial intelligence platform for training, simulation and in-vehicle computing, the resulting system is designed to safely handle fully autonomous driving on public roads and highways,” Volvo said in a statement. Nvidia said it was thrilled to team up with Volvo. “The latest breakthroughs in AI and robotics bring a new level of intelligence and automation to address the transportation challenges we face,”  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said.

Work will begin immediately in Santa Clara, California, and Gothenburg, Sweden. Financial terms were not disclosed. Volvo, which last year demonstrated its first cabin-less autonomous truck, Vera, said the partnership would develop a flexible, scalable self-driving system, which is planned to be used first in pilot schemes before commercial deployment. “The resulting system is designed to safely handle fully autonomous driving on public roads and highways,” Volvo said in a statement. Nvidia, known for its powerful gaming graphics chips, has been aggressively expanding into the automotive sphere, where trucks - with their regular routes that are easier to automate than cars navigating traffic - may lead the way in self-driving. Nvidia dominates the fast-growing AI chip market alongside Intel Corp. Tesla, Ford Motor Co, Daimler and several startups are racing each other towards autonomy, using closed-area pilots such as warehouse-to-warehouse delivery or mining-site operations to speed up testing and commercialization. Volvo’s first commercial autonomous technology will move into real operation from pilot mode in winter this year. Seven Volvo FH16 trucks will transport limestone for Norway’s Broennoey Kalk AS from a mine to a nearby port, Volvo Trucks’ autonomous solutions director, Sasko Cuklev said, on Tuesday. “This coming winter, Volvo Trucks’ autonomous mining solution will be in operation and we will get paid per transported tonne,” Cuklev said at the company’s annual general meeting in Gothenburg. He said the seven trucks, together with a site management system, truck services and support, workshop set-up and insurance would be wrapped together to make Volvo’s first commercial autonomous transport package.  Volvo Chief Technology Officer Lars Stenqvist said he preferred not to set a firm date for when a self-driving Volvo truck using Nvidia technology would travel a public highway. Deployment will start in areas that are not open to the public and “gradually grow into more complex situations,” he told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday. “We are humble as to the challenges we have.”     Morgan Stanley analysts said last month that Nvidia-backed startup TuSimple had secured 12 customers that were generating revenue. TuSimple last month said it had begun testing for the U.S. Postal Service. PILOT PROJECT Nvidia, which has previously announced technology partnerships with automakers including Volkswagen AG, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota Motor Corp , said it was thrilled to team up with Volvo.    “The latest breakthroughs in AI and robotics bring a new level of intelligence and automation to address the transportation challenges we face,”  Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told reporters on a conference call. Huang emphasized that for Nvidia the partnership with Volvo goes beyond supplying chips, and includes work on developing software, on-board computers and sensor systems for autonomous commercial vehicles. “The technology inside the vehicle is much more significant than we would apply” to a consumer-owned car, he said. Volvo said last week its Vera self-driving truck would begin transporting goods from a logistics center to a port terminal in Gothenburg in collaboration with logistics firm DFDS, in a first step towards operations on public roads. Systems designed under the partnership with Nvidia would be used to develop vehicles capable of operating on public streets, Stenqvist said. Nvidia’s so-called Drive Constellation chips often power the machine learning used to refine self-driving car software algorithms inside data centers, and the company has also been working to build its Drive chips into cars.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/FilesNEW YORK (Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia Corp is nearing a deal to acquire peer Mellanox Technologies Ltd for more than $7 billion in cash, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday.      The deal would be Nvidia’s biggest-ever acquisition and boost its business of making chips for data centers, allowing it to reduce its reliance on the video game industry, for which it is best known as a major technology vendor.     Nvidia has outbid Intel Corp in the auction for Mellanox and could announce a deal as early as Monday, the person said. The source asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.  Intel and Mellanox did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment. Financial news website Calcalist had reported earlier on Sunday that Nvidia had outbid Intel for Mellanox.     Mellanox’s chips power high-speed networks connecting servers.

The three main Wall Street indexes are on track for their third week of decline, after the inversion of a U.S. yield curve on Wednesday pointed to a looming recession. China said overnight that it was planning to roll out stimulus to stymie an economic slowdown. Investors were also looking forward to interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank next month to fight softening economic growth. Among stocks, Nvidia Corp jumped 6% in premarket trading after posting better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. Other semiconductor stocks, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Micron Technology Inc, Intel Corp, were up between 1.5% and 3.2%. At 7:02 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 251 points, or 0.98%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 28.5 points, or 1% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 96.75 points, or 1.29%. Upbeat U.S. retail sales data on Thursday overshadowed conflicting signals on trade. President Donald Trump said both sides were holding “productive” trade talks even as Beijing vowed to take necessary counter-measures to the latest round of tariffs on Chinese goods. The drawn-out trade war between the world’s largest economies and fears about its fallout on global growth have led to a more than 4% drop in the three main indexes this month. Interest-rate sensitive lenders, including Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and Morgan Stanley, rose above 1% as U.S. Treasury bond yields eased off their lows. The so-called FAANG group - which includes Facebook Inc , Amazon.com Inc, Apple, Netflix Inc and Google-parent Alphabet Inc - gained between 1.2% and 1.6%. Deere & Co shares fell 2.8% as the farm equipment maker cut its full-year profit and sales growth forecasts.

The logo of technology company Nvidia is seen at its headquarters in Santa Clara, California February 11, 2015. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File PhotoAt a gathering of graphics professionals on Monday, Nvidia rolled out its newest generation of chip technology, called Turing after the legendary British computer scientist Alan Turing.  The biggest selling point of the chips is an improvement in so-called “ray tracing,” or the ability for the chip to simulate how light rays will bounce around in a visual scene. That task takes so much computing power that designers have to wait while a chip churns through the data to see the results of their work. Nvidia says the new generation of chips will let designers make those changes in real time, which could speed up the creative process - and which Nvidia hopes customers will pay a premium for. “Turing is Nvidia’s most important innovation in computer graphics in more than a decade,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement. The Santa Clara, California-based company’s shares have risen more than 50 percent over the past year, backed by data center chip sales that more than doubled to $1.9 billion its last fiscal year. Nvidia’s data center chips power artificial intelligence tasks training computers to recognize images and are increasingly eating away Intel Corp’s (INTC.O) growth opportunities. And Nvidia’s biggest business, its consumer chips that let video gamers play with improved graphics, grew 35 percent to $5.5 billion in its most recent fiscal year. That growth came from hot gaming titles such Epic Games’ Fortnite and the fact that the chips were adopted by homespun cryptocurrency enthusiasts. But Nvidia’s middle line of chips, aimed at graphics and design professionals who make films and other digital content, has not fared nearly as well, growing only 11.8 percent last year to $934 million. Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights and Strategy and a former chip executive, said Nvidia is likely looking to stave off competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O), which is likely to target the same group of professional users with its new graphics chips next year. Nvidia’s existing strength in the data center market and the high-end gaming market have left it most open to attack in the middle of the market. “Where Nvidia gets the biggest bump right now (from a new chip generation) is in the workstation market, which makes it all that more competitive,” Moorhead said.

A NVIDIA graphics card is shown in a gaming computer in Encinitas, California, U.S., August 14, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Blake/FilesWith new software it calls RAPIDS, Nvidia is hoping to move beyond the fast-growing but relatively small market for artificial intelligence chips. It’s aiming for the much larger market for chips that do basic business data crunching such as forecasting inventories. Nvidia announced the software at a conference in Germany. Nvidia got its start in the 1990s with graphics processors to make video games look more realistic. But in recent years its chips have become used as so-called “accelerators” in data centers to speed up artificial intelligence work, like training computers to recognize images or human speech. Nvidia’s processors are not direct replacements for Intel’s general purpose computing chips. But when businesses use a lot of Nvidia’s chips, they often buy Intel’s chips at a slower rate. Nvidia’s strong position in the artificial intelligence field came from its software efforts rather than its chips alone. About a decade ago, Nvidia created a platform that would let developers program its chips for a wide range of tasks rather than just video game graphics. Artificial intelligence researchers embraced it. But for all the buzz artificial intelligence generates, other types of computing - like perfecting analytical models for more accurate inventory forecasts - are more common in businesses. Nvidia’s new software aims to speed up that kind of work. Nvidia has teamed up with a range of companies, including Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Oracle Corp and a branch of International Business Machines, to release the new tools. They are being used by Walmart Inc, Nvidia said. “It’s really an ecosystem we’re trying to build out,” Jeff Tseng, head of product for artificial intelligence infrastructure at Nvidia, told Reuters in an interview. But Nvidia will have a tough fight against Intel, whose chips are already the industry standard for business analytics work. The key will be for Nvidia to find early customers for whom the speed benefits outweigh the cost of new chips, said Stephen O’Grady, an industry analyst with RedMonk “In many cases where we’re talking about basic data science, it’s going to be computationally faster,” he said. “This is their big play to get into the general purpose data science side of things.” Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Cynthia OstermanOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

And Nvidia’s biggest business, its consumer chips that let video gamers play with improved graphics, grew 35 percent to $5.5 billion in its most recent fiscal year. That growth came from hot gaming titles such Epic Games’ Fortnite and the fact that the chips were adopted by homespun cryptocurrency enthusiasts. But Nvidia’s middle line of chips, aimed at graphics and design professionals who make films and other digital content, has not fared nearly as well, growing only 11.8 percent last year to $934 million. Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights and Strategy and a former chip executive, said Nvidia is likely looking to stave off competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O), which is likely to target the same group of professional users with its new graphics chips next year. Nvidia’s existing strength in the data center market and the high-end gaming market have left it most open to attack in the middle of the market. “Where Nvidia gets the biggest bump right now (from a new chip generation) is in the workstation market, which makes it all that more competitive,” Moorhead said.

A NVIDIA graphics card is shown in a gaming computer in Encinitas, California, U.S., August 14, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Blake/FilesWith new software it calls RAPIDS, Nvidia is hoping to move beyond the fast-growing but relatively small market for artificial intelligence chips. It’s aiming for the much larger market for chips that do basic business data crunching such as forecasting inventories. Nvidia announced the software at a conference in Germany. Nvidia got its start in the 1990s with graphics processors to make video games look more realistic. But in recent years its chips have become used as so-called “accelerators” in data centers to speed up artificial intelligence work, like training computers to recognize images or human speech. Nvidia’s processors are not direct replacements for Intel’s general purpose computing chips. But when businesses use a lot of Nvidia’s chips, they often buy Intel’s chips at a slower rate. Nvidia’s strong position in the artificial intelligence field came from its software efforts rather than its chips alone. About a decade ago, Nvidia created a platform that would let developers program its chips for a wide range of tasks rather than just video game graphics. Artificial intelligence researchers embraced it. But for all the buzz artificial intelligence generates, other types of computing - like perfecting analytical models for more accurate inventory forecasts - are more common in businesses. Nvidia’s new software aims to speed up that kind of work. Nvidia has teamed up with a range of companies, including Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Oracle Corp and a branch of International Business Machines, to release the new tools. They are being used by Walmart Inc, Nvidia said. “It’s really an ecosystem we’re trying to build out,” Jeff Tseng, head of product for artificial intelligence infrastructure at Nvidia, told Reuters in an interview. But Nvidia will have a tough fight against Intel, whose chips are already the industry standard for business analytics work. The key will be for Nvidia to find early customers for whom the speed benefits outweigh the cost of new chips, said Stephen O’Grady, an industry analyst with RedMonk “In many cases where we’re talking about basic data science, it’s going to be computationally faster,” he said. “This is their big play to get into the general purpose data science side of things.” Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Cynthia OstermanOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo/File Photo(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it plans to roll out a version of its cloud-based software that will be modified to suit the needs of healthcare organizations. While Microsoft is known for general productivity software such as Outlook and the chat app Teams, it also makes more specialized business software such as programs used by customer service agents and artificial intelligence tools that software developers can use to make chat bots. Microsoft said it will pull all of its technologies together into a package it calls “Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare.” The system will allow hospitals to maintain data throughout an interaction with a patient. For example, a patient might first visit a health care organization’s patient portal website. The initial questions would be answered by a chatbot that has been programmed by health care professionals, but then handed off to a service agent who could ask more questions and schedule a virtual visit with a nurse or doctor. That visit could then be held over Microsoft Teams video chat. If the patient then comes to a clinic in person for a follow-up visit, all the data from the previous interactions will be available to the health care professional who sees the patient. “We want to carry all that information through the health experience,” Deb Cupp, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of enterprise and commercial industries, told Reuters in an interview.  Microsoft also said it plans to make the system work with electronic health record software providers such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc.  Microsoft said it aims to offer the healthcare system as a free trial over the next six months. It also plans more industry-specific cloud software offerings in the future, but it did not say which industries it planned to target.

The new datacentre region will be based in the Milan area, joining Microsoft’s other 60 regions announced globally. In February, Microsoft announced plans to open a new datacentre region in Spain and earlier this week the company said it would invest $1 billion in Poland as part of plans to open a data centre to provide cloud services to businesses and institutions. Also in Italy, Microsoft, under a five-year plan, will provide access to local cloud services and launch digital skilling and smart-working and artificial intelligence programs for small and medium enterprises.

The initial questions would be answered by a chatbot that has been programmed by health care professionals, but then handed off to a service agent who could ask more questions and schedule a virtual visit with a nurse or doctor. That visit could then be held over Microsoft Teams video chat. If the patient then comes to a clinic in person for a follow-up visit, all the data from the previous interactions will be available to the health care professional who sees the patient. “We want to carry all that information through the health experience,” Deb Cupp, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of enterprise and commercial industries, told Reuters in an interview.  Microsoft also said it plans to make the system work with electronic health record software providers such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc.  Microsoft said it aims to offer the healthcare system as a free trial over the next six months. It also plans more industry-specific cloud software offerings in the future, but it did not say which industries it planned to target.

A Microsoft logo is seen in Los Angeles, California U.S. November 7, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/FilesThe company’s shares, up over 12% this year, rose about 5% in extended trading. The results reflect Chief Executive Satya Nadella’s focus over his six-year tenure on cloud computing, in which companies tap Microsoft’s data centers for computing power - a growing business dominated by Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft gave business-unit forecasts that were below analyst estimates, predicting tough times for LinkedIn and some small-business software sales. “Ultimately, Microsoft is not immune from what is going on broadly in the world in terms of GDP growth,” Nadella said on a conference call with investors. But results benefited from sales of its Windows operating system and Surface hardware devices as people upgraded personal computers to work or study from home. Microsoft also cited all-time-high engagement on its Xbox Live gaming service, with 90 million monthly active users. “The biggest missed opportunity was in Surface, where demand was huge, the channel inventory was depleted, and supply chain constraints reduced finished goods output,” said Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead. “I believe the company could have easily sold 15-20% more if available.” Microsoft also benefited from strong demand for its Teams collaboration software, which Nadella said on a conference call now has 75 million daily active users and competes with Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O) and Slack Technologies Inc (WORK.N). The demand influx strained Microsoft’s data centers, forcing it to limit new cloud customers’ usage and prioritize healthcare and government users. In an interview, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said some of the increased Teams usage came from subscribers with access to the software as part of a broader package and turned it on for the first time. In other cases, Hood said, Microsoft offered Teams in a free trial to large customers. “In those instances, you also won’t see revenue, but seeing great usage obviously is terrific for us longer term if people want to convert that to a paying seat,” Hood said. “While I’m really excited about the long-term potential for revenue, you won’t see it in this (fiscal third) quarter, or really even in Q4. It’s more about people being more and more engaged with Microsoft products.” Responding to analysts’ questions, Microsoft executives declined to specify when they would start charging Teams customers on free trials. “Immediate term, we are mostly building out the relationships, adding new customers, adding intensity and usage in existing relationships,” Nadella said on the call. Third-quarter sales were helped by demand for cloud services. However, Azure growth slowed to 59% from 62% in the second quarter, which company officials said was a result of how large the business has become. “Despite the slowed growth, (Azure) operates at approximately 10 times the scale of Google (by annual revenues) and has seen better enterprise adoption so far,” said Daniel Elman, an analyst at Nucleus Research. Microsoft said revenue for its “commercial cloud,” a combination of Azure and the cloud-based versions of software such as Office, rose 39% to $13.3 billion. The business’ gross profit margin, a key measure of cloud profitability that Microsoft has told investors it expects to improve, was 67% versus 63% last year. Microsoft also said capital expenditure was $3.9 billion, up from $3.4 billion a year earlier and less than the $4.5 billion the previous quarter. However, Hood told Reuters that supply chain constraints due to the coronavirus pandemic had delayed some spending to build Azure data centers, which will likely be higher next quarter as the company works to catch up. Revenue in the Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, rose 27% to $12.28 billion, beating analysts’ consensus estimate of $11.87 billion according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue rose 15% to $35.02 billion in the third quarter ending March 31, beating estimates of $33.66 billion.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoMILAN (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. said on Friday it would create its first datacentre region in Italy under a $1.5 billion investment plan as the U.S. company expands its cloud computing services to more locations across the world.  Microsoft’s rival Amazon Web Services last week opened a datacentre region in Milan, while in March Google’s Inc sealed a partnership with former phone monopoly Telecom Italia to expand cloud business operations in Italy.    Analysts expect the Italian cloud market to grow at a double digit pace in the next few years as companies, which have embraced smartworking during the coronavirus crisis, will increasingly rely on digital processes for their business.  Jean-Philippe Courtois, Microsoft’s head of global sales, marketing and operations, said the company saw enormous potential to accelerate innovation through cloud services.  The new datacentre region will be based in the Milan area, joining Microsoft’s other 60 regions announced globally. In February, Microsoft announced plans to open a new datacentre region in Spain and earlier this week the company said it would invest $1 billion in Poland as part of plans to open a data centre to provide cloud services to businesses and institutions. Also in Italy, Microsoft, under a five-year plan, will provide access to local cloud services and launch digital skilling and smart-working and artificial intelligence programs for small and medium enterprises. The company will also expand its technology partnership with state-controlled postal operator Poste Italiane, helping the company to accelerate its digital transformation.

The results reflect Chief Executive Satya Nadella’s focus over his six-year tenure on cloud computing, in which companies tap Microsoft’s data centers for computing power - a growing business dominated by Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft gave business-unit forecasts that were below analyst estimates, predicting tough times for LinkedIn and some small-business software sales. “Ultimately, Microsoft is not immune from what is going on broadly in the world in terms of GDP growth,” Nadella said on a conference call with investors. But results benefited from sales of its Windows operating system and Surface hardware devices as people upgraded personal computers to work or study from home. Microsoft also cited all-time-high engagement on its Xbox Live gaming service, with 90 million monthly active users. “The biggest missed opportunity was in Surface, where demand was huge, the channel inventory was depleted, and supply chain constraints reduced finished goods output,” said Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead. “I believe the company could have easily sold 15-20% more if available.” Microsoft also benefited from strong demand for its Teams collaboration software, which Nadella said on a conference call now has 75 million daily active users and competes with Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O) and Slack Technologies Inc (WORK.N). The demand influx strained Microsoft’s data centers, forcing it to limit new cloud customers’ usage and prioritize healthcare and government users. In an interview, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said some of the increased Teams usage came from subscribers with access to the software as part of a broader package and turned it on for the first time. In other cases, Hood said, Microsoft offered Teams in a free trial to large customers. “In those instances, you also won’t see revenue, but seeing great usage obviously is terrific for us longer term if people want to convert that to a paying seat,” Hood said. “While I’m really excited about the long-term potential for revenue, you won’t see it in this (fiscal third) quarter, or really even in Q4. It’s more about people being more and more engaged with Microsoft products.” Responding to analysts’ questions, Microsoft executives declined to specify when they would start charging Teams customers on free trials. “Immediate term, we are mostly building out the relationships, adding new customers, adding intensity and usage in existing relationships,” Nadella said on the call. Third-quarter sales were helped by demand for cloud services. However, Azure growth slowed to 59% from 62% in the second quarter, which company officials said was a result of how large the business has become. “Despite the slowed growth, (Azure) operates at approximately 10 times the scale of Google (by annual revenues) and has seen better enterprise adoption so far,” said Daniel Elman, an analyst at Nucleus Research. Microsoft said revenue for its “commercial cloud,” a combination of Azure and the cloud-based versions of software such as Office, rose 39% to $13.3 billion. The business’ gross profit margin, a key measure of cloud profitability that Microsoft has told investors it expects to improve, was 67% versus 63% last year. Microsoft also said capital expenditure was $3.9 billion, up from $3.4 billion a year earlier and less than the $4.5 billion the previous quarter. However, Hood told Reuters that supply chain constraints due to the coronavirus pandemic had delayed some spending to build Azure data centers, which will likely be higher next quarter as the company works to catch up. Revenue in the Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, rose 27% to $12.28 billion, beating analysts’ consensus estimate of $11.87 billion according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue rose 15% to $35.02 billion in the third quarter ending March 31, beating estimates of $33.66 billion. (bit.ly/3f1Yeu3) Net income rose to $10.75 billion, or $1.40 per share, from $8.81 billion, or $1.14 per share, a year earlier.

Microsoft said it had signed an agreement with domestic cloud provider Chmura Krajowa (National Cloud) to provide cloud services in Poland, as the central European country seeks to position itself as a regional centre for technology. “I deeply believe that Microsoft’s investment in Poland will be important for enterprises, public institutions and the education system and will enable them to digitally transform and implement new work standards,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said in a statement.  Chmura Krajowa (National Cloud) was formed in 2018 by Poland’s largest bank, PKO Bank Polski, and the Polish Development Fund (PFR) with the aim of speeding up the digitalisation of businesses and the public administration, according to its website. The partnership with Microsoft will last for seven years and will involve training people in Poland in cloud-based technology.

REUTERS/Baz Ratner(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Monday said it had won a five-year deal with Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) to supply business software, including its Teams chat app and tools for customer service agents. The companies did not disclose the size of the deal but said it will include Dynamics 365, a suite of Microsoft tools that competes directly with Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N).  Microsoft has a stronghold in general-purpose business software such as email and word processing apps but has been working to win more customers for its specialized software such as apps used by customer service and sales employees. James Phillips, the corporate vice president for Microsoft’s business applications group, told Reuters in an interview that Coca-Cola will use Microsoft technology to pull together information several internal systems, using artificial intelligence to fetch data from them and answer questions. In the first phase, Phillips said, Coke will offer the system internally to employees “rather than making the employee understand that you need to go over here to request vacation time, over there to look at your last payroll slip, or to some other system to understand what educational courses may be available.” Barry Simpson, senior vice president and chief information and integrated services officer of Coca-Cola, said in a statement that Microsoft’s software would help the company by “replacing previously disparate and fragmented systems.” Eventually, Microsoft’s Phillips said, Coca-Cola’s customer service agents plan to use system to help quickly answer questions from the beverage maker’s customers, which include major retailers and grocers.

She will continue to hold the position of chief technology officer of Microsoft Cloud and Artificial Intelligence Security. Braverman-Blumenstyk is one of the highest-ranking Israelis in cybersecurity and a female leader in the field, the company said. She replaces Assaf Rappaport, who moved on in January. The Microsoft Israel Development Center is the company’s first research and development center outside the United States. Established in 1991, about half its employees engage in cybersecurity. Braverman-Blumenstyk joined Microsoft in 2013, founding the cybersecurity center which employs hundreds of developers and cyber experts, some of whom came on board with the acquisition of Israeli startups.

REUTERS/Baz Ratner(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Monday said it had won a five-year deal with Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) to supply business software, including its Teams chat app and tools for customer service agents. The companies did not disclose the size of the deal but said it will include Dynamics 365, a suite of Microsoft tools that competes directly with Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N).  Microsoft has a stronghold in general-purpose business software such as email and word processing apps but has been working to win more customers for its specialized software such as apps used by customer service and sales employees. James Phillips, the corporate vice president for Microsoft’s business applications group, told Reuters in an interview that Coca-Cola will use Microsoft technology to pull together information several internal systems, using artificial intelligence to fetch data from them and answer questions. In the first phase, Phillips said, Coke will offer the system internally to employees “rather than making the employee understand that you need to go over here to request vacation time, over there to look at your last payroll slip, or to some other system to understand what educational courses may be available.” Barry Simpson, senior vice president and chief information and integrated services officer of Coca-Cola, said in a statement that Microsoft’s software would help the company by “replacing previously disparate and fragmented systems.” Eventually, Microsoft’s Phillips said, Coca-Cola’s customer service agents plan to use system to help quickly answer questions from the beverage maker’s customers, which include major retailers and grocers.

Microsoft’s rival Amazon Web Services last week opened a datacentre region in Milan, while in March Google’s Inc sealed a parternership with former phone monopoly Telecom Italia to expand cloud business operations in Italy. Analysts expect the Italian cloud market to grow at a double digit pace in the next few years as companies, which have embraced smartworking during the coronavirus crisis, will increasingly rely on digital processes for their business. Jean-Philippe Courtois, Microsoft’s head of global sales, marketing and operations, said the company saw enormous potential to accelerate innovation through cloud services. The new datacentre region will be based in the Milan area, joining Microsoft’s other 60 regions announced globally. In February, Microsoft announced plans to open a new datacentre region in Spain and earlier this week the company said it would invest $1 billion in Poland as part of plans to open a data centre to provide cloud services to businesses and institutions. Also in Italy, Microsoft, under a five-year plan, will provide access to local cloud services and launch digital skilling and smart-working and artificial intelligence programmes for small and medium enterprises. The company will also expand its technology partnership with state-controlled postal operator Poste Italiane, helping the company to accelerate its digital transformation.

India’s southern city of Hyderabad, where Nadella grew up, is home to Microsoft’s biggest research and development center outside of the United States. Nadella is planning to be in India between Feb. 24 and Feb. 26 and will likely visit New Delhi, tech hub Bengaluru and the financial capital of Mumbai, two people familiar with the plans said. He is also likely to meet senior Indian industry leaders during his visit, the sources said. The sources did not want to be identified because the company has yet to make a public announcement. Microsoft declined to comment when asked about a visit. “We don’t have anything to share at the moment,” a company spokeswoman said. Microsoft also is trying arrange for Nadella to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one of the sources added, although the meeting has yet to be confirmed. The Prime Minister’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Nadella last month stoked controversy in India when he was quoted by Buzzfeed as saying here a new law implemented by Modi's government that eases the path to citizenship for non-Muslims in nearby nations was ""just bad"".   His comments drew sharp criticism from Modi’s ruling party. Microsoft issued a statement later quoting Nadella as saying that every country has the right to protect and define its borders.     A visit by Nadella would be in the midst of the government taking a tougher stance against foreign technology companies competing in the domestic market by drafting laws aimed at more tightly-controlled cross-border data flows. The visit would also be a month after Amazon.com Inc CEO Jeff Bezos made a trip to the country and was snubbed by senior members of the government. India has taken a hard stance against the U.S. e-commerce sector, with Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart facing an antitrust probe and criticism from brick-and-mortar traders against their business practices. When Bezos visited India last month and announced a new $1 billion investment, India’s trade minister brushed him off by saying Amazon was doing no “great favor” to India.

A Microsoft logo is seen in Los Angeles, California U.S. November 7, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/FilesThe company’s shares, up over 12% this year, rose about 5% in extended trading. The results reflect Chief Executive Satya Nadella’s focus over his six-year tenure on cloud computing, in which companies tap Microsoft’s data centers for computing power - a growing business dominated by Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft gave business-unit forecasts that were below analyst estimates, predicting tough times for LinkedIn and some small-business software sales. “Ultimately, Microsoft is not immune from what is going on broadly in the world in terms of GDP growth,” Nadella said on a conference call with investors. But results benefited from sales of its Windows operating system and Surface hardware devices as people upgraded personal computers to work or study from home. Microsoft also cited all-time-high engagement on its Xbox Live gaming service, with 90 million monthly active users. “The biggest missed opportunity was in Surface, where demand was huge, the channel inventory was depleted, and supply chain constraints reduced finished goods output,” said Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead. “I believe the company could have easily sold 15-20% more if available.” Microsoft also benefited from strong demand for its Teams collaboration software, which Nadella said on a conference call now has 75 million daily active users and competes with Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O) and Slack Technologies Inc (WORK.N). The demand influx strained Microsoft’s data centers, forcing it to limit new cloud customers’ usage and prioritize healthcare and government users. In an interview, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said some of the increased Teams usage came from subscribers with access to the software as part of a broader package and turned it on for the first time. In other cases, Hood said, Microsoft offered Teams in a free trial to large customers. “In those instances, you also won’t see revenue, but seeing great usage obviously is terrific for us longer term if people want to convert that to a paying seat,” Hood said. “While I’m really excited about the long-term potential for revenue, you won’t see it in this (fiscal third) quarter, or really even in Q4. It’s more about people being more and more engaged with Microsoft products.” Responding to analysts’ questions, Microsoft executives declined to specify when they would start charging Teams customers on free trials. “Immediate term, we are mostly building out the relationships, adding new customers, adding intensity and usage in existing relationships,” Nadella said on the call. Third-quarter sales were helped by demand for cloud services. However, Azure growth slowed to 59% from 62% in the second quarter, which company officials said was a result of how large the business has become. “Despite the slowed growth, (Azure) operates at approximately 10 times the scale of Google (by annual revenues) and has seen better enterprise adoption so far,” said Daniel Elman, an analyst at Nucleus Research. Microsoft said revenue for its “commercial cloud,” a combination of Azure and the cloud-based versions of software such as Office, rose 39% to $13.3 billion. The business’ gross profit margin, a key measure of cloud profitability that Microsoft has told investors it expects to improve, was 67% versus 63% last year. Microsoft also said capital expenditure was $3.9 billion, up from $3.4 billion a year earlier and less than the $4.5 billion the previous quarter. However, Hood told Reuters that supply chain constraints due to the coronavirus pandemic had delayed some spending to build Azure data centers, which will likely be higher next quarter as the company works to catch up. Revenue in the Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, rose 27% to $12.28 billion, beating analysts’ consensus estimate of $11.87 billion according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue rose 15% to $35.02 billion in the third quarter ending March 31, beating estimates of $33.66 billion. (bit.ly/3f1Yeu3) Net income rose to $10.75 billion, or $1.40 per share, from $8.81 billion, or $1.14 per share, a year earlier.

The Redmond, Washington-based software giant said would continue to serve customers online, with team members working remotely from corporate facilities. It was not immediately clear if Microsoft’s move would lead to any layoffs. The company also said it will rethink other spaces that serve all customers, including operating Microsoft Experience Centers in London, New York City, Sydney, and Redmond campus locations. “This is a tough, but smart strategic decision for (CEO) Nadella & Co. to make at this point.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid//File PhotoNEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, has partnered with Microsoft Corp to have its Aladdin investment and risk management system hosted on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform, the companies said on Tuesday. The migration to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform will take place over many months and Aladdin users are not expected to see any impact in the near term, BlackRock said. “Aladdin infrastructure deployed on Microsoft Azure’s cloud platform will provide BlackRock with enhanced capabilities to deliver the best outcomes for our Aladdin clients,” Rob Goldstein, chief operating officer at BlackRock, said in a statement. The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. BlackRock’s Aladdin system is used by asset managers to help manage the risk in their portfolios and assist them in trading, data management and other operations. Aladdin, which began as internal investment management software, has in recent years been opened up for use by wealth managers such as UBS, Morgan Stanley and HSBC as BlackRock tries to increase revenue from technology.     Continued investment in Aladdin and its 2019 acquisition of French software provider eFront helped boost BlackRock’s technology services revenue to almost $1 billion for 2019.

FILE PHOTO - Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addresses a news conference in Berlin, Germany February 27, 2019. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch India is a major market for Microsoft and other technology companies. India’s southern city of Hyderabad, where Nadella grew up, is home to Microsoft’s biggest research and development center outside of the United States. Nadella is planning to be in India between Feb. 24 and Feb. 26 and will likely visit New Delhi, tech hub Bengaluru and the financial capital of Mumbai, two people familiar with the plans said. He is also likely to meet senior Indian industry leaders during his visit, the sources said. The sources did not want to be identified because the company has yet to make a public announcement. Microsoft declined to comment when asked about a visit. “We don’t have anything to share at the moment,” a company spokeswoman said. Microsoft also is trying arrange for Nadella to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one of the sources added, although the meeting has yet to be confirmed. The Prime Minister’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Nadella last month stoked controversy in India when he was quoted by Buzzfeed as saying here a new law implemented by Modi's government that eases the path to citizenship for non-Muslims in nearby nations was ""just bad"".   His comments drew sharp criticism from Modi’s ruling party. Microsoft issued a statement later quoting Nadella as saying that every country has the right to protect and define its borders.     A visit by Nadella would be in the midst of the government taking a tougher stance against foreign technology companies competing in the domestic market by drafting laws aimed at more tightly-controlled cross-border data flows. The visit would also be a month after Amazon.com Inc CEO Jeff Bezos made a trip to the country and was snubbed by senior members of the government. India has taken a hard stance against the U.S. e-commerce sector, with Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart facing an antitrust probe and criticism from brick-and-mortar traders against their business practices. When Bezos visited India last month and announced a new $1 billion investment, India’s trade minister brushed him off by saying Amazon was doing no “great favor” to India. Modi also did not meet Bezos despite repeated requests by the company.

Shares of the world’s largest software company hit an all-time high in after-hours trading. The results reflected the approach of Chief Executive Satya Nadella, who for five years has re-centred Microsoft around the cloud, renting out its computing power and technology to large businesses. Microsoft said Azure, its primary competitor to Amazon’s cloud, grew 62% in the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, down from a 76% revenue growth rate the year before but up from 59% in the fiscal first quarter. Microsoft’s chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said increased consumption of Azure services, which include offerings such as computing power to run applications and data storage services, drove the revenue growth. “We did have good usage, which matters a ton to that number,” Hood told Reuters. “The core thing that we focused on - which is consumption growth - was quite good.” Microsoft said revenue for its “commercial cloud” - a combination of Azure and the cloud-based versions of software such as Office - reached $12.5 billion, up from $9 billion the year before. The commercial cloud gross profit margin - a key measure of cloud profitability that Microsoft has told investors it expects to improve - was 67%, versus 62% the year before. Microsoft shares rose as much as 4.58% to $175.74 in after-hours trading. “This quarter was an absolute ‘blow out quarter’ across the board with no blemishes and in our opinion speaks to an inflection point in deal flow as more enterprises pick Redmond for the cloud,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note, referring to Microsoft’s headquarters location in Redmond, Washington. Hood said the company was working to improve margins on its core Azure services, which rely on data centres that can cost billions of dollars to build. She cited “hardware improvements and taking advantage of those hardware improvements.” Microsoft’s revenue and profit for the second quarter were $36.9 billion and $1.51 per share, respectively, compared with analyst estimates of $35.7 billion and $1.32 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Microsoft has focused on hybrid cloud computing – in which a business can use a mix of Microsoft’s data centres and its own – as well as on delivering its longstanding productivity programs such as Office via the cloud. The shift to the cloud has driven Microsoft’s shares up more than 50% in the past year, as it gains ground against market leader Amazon and also parries the threats to its classic software programs from newer entrants like Alphabet Inc’s Google. In 2019, Microsoft had 22% share of the cloud computing infrastructure market, compared with 45% at Amazon and 5% from Google, according to data from Forrester Research. “Azure’s renewed growth doesn’t yet pose a threat to AWS’s supremacy in the cloud market, but it does present an opportunity to further close the gap on Amazon and increase its lead over other cloud providers,” said Andrew MacMillen of Nucleus Research. The company’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure, reported revenue that rose 27% to $11.9 billion in the quarter, versus expectations of $11.4 billion. For the fiscal third quarter ending in March, Microsoft forecast revenue with a midpoint of $11.9 billion for the unit, compared with analyst expectations of $11.4 billion.

Microsoft forecast revenue of between $10.75 billion (8.2 billion pounds) and $11.15 billion for the unit containing Windows in the fiscal third quarter, a wider-than-normal forecast range that the company said was because of uncertainty surrounding the spread of the coronavirus in China.

The Redmond, Washington-based software giant said it would continue to serve customers online, with team members working remotely from corporate facilities. A Microsoft spokeswoman told Reuters all current retail employees would be given an opportunity to remain with the company in different roles. “Speaking over 120 languages, their diversity reflects the many communities we serve,” Microsoft Corporate Vice President David Porter said of the company’s retail employees in a statement. “Our commitment to growing and developing careers from this talent pool is stronger than ever.”The company also said it will rethink other spaces that serve all customers, including operating Microsoft Experience Centers in London, New York, Sydney, and Redmond campus locations. “This is a tough but smart strategic decision for (CEO) Nadella & Co. to make at this point.

Shares of the world’s largest software company hit an all-time high in after-hours trading. The results reflected the approach of Chief Executive Satya Nadella, who for five years has re-centred Microsoft around the cloud, renting out its computing power and technology to large businesses. Microsoft said Azure, its primary competitor to Amazon’s cloud, grew 62% in the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, down from a 76% revenue growth rate the year before but up from 59% in the fiscal first quarter. Microsoft’s chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said increased consumption of Azure services, which include offerings such as computing power to run applications and data storage services, drove the revenue growth. “We did have good usage, which matters a ton to that number,” Hood told Reuters. “The core thing that we focused on - which is consumption growth - was quite good.” Microsoft said revenue for its “commercial cloud” - a combination of Azure and the cloud-based versions of software such as Office - reached $12.5 billion, up from $9 billion the year before. The commercial cloud gross profit margin - a key measure of cloud profitability that Microsoft has told investors it expects to improve - was 67%, versus 62% the year before. Microsoft shares rose as much as 4.58% to $175.74 in after-hours trading. “This quarter was an absolute ‘blow out quarter’ across the board with no blemishes and in our opinion speaks to an inflection point in deal flow as more enterprises pick Redmond for the cloud,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note, referring to Microsoft’s headquarters location in Redmond, Washington. Hood said the company was working to improve margins on its core Azure services, which rely on data centres that can cost billions of dollars to build. She cited “hardware improvements and taking advantage of those hardware improvements.” Microsoft’s revenue and profit for the second quarter were $36.9 billion and $1.51 per share, respectively, compared with analyst estimates of $35.7 billion and $1.32 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Microsoft has focused on hybrid cloud computing – in which a business can use a mix of Microsoft’s data centres and its own – as well as on delivering its longstanding productivity programs such as Office via the cloud. The shift to the cloud has driven Microsoft’s shares up more than 50% in the past year, as it gains ground against market leader Amazon and also parries the threats to its classic software programs from newer entrants like Alphabet Inc’s Google. In 2019, Microsoft had 22% share of the cloud computing infrastructure market, compared with 45% at Amazon and 5% from Google, according to data from Forrester Research. “Azure’s renewed growth doesn’t yet pose a threat to AWS’s supremacy in the cloud market, but it does present an opportunity to further close the gap on Amazon and increase its lead over other cloud providers,” said Andrew MacMillen of Nucleus Research. The company’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure, reported revenue that rose 27% to $11.9 billion in the quarter, versus expectations of $11.4 billion. For the fiscal third quarter ending in March, Microsoft forecast revenue with a midpoint of $11.9 billion for the unit, compared with analyst expectations of $11.4 billion.

Microsoft forecast revenue of between $10.75 billion (8.2 billion pounds) and $11.15 billion for the unit containing Windows in the fiscal third quarter, a wider-than-normal forecast range that the company said was because of uncertainty surrounding the spread of the coronavirus in China.

Microsoft said it had signed an agreement with domestic cloud provider Chmura Krajowa (National Cloud) to provide cloud services in Poland, as the central European country seeks to position itself as a regional centre for technology. “I deeply believe that Microsoft’s investment in Poland will be important for enterprises, public institutions and the education system and will enable them to digitally transform and implement new work standards,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said in a statement.  Chmura Krajowa (National Cloud) was formed in 2018 by Poland’s largest bank, PKO Bank Polski, and the Polish Development Fund (PFR) with the aim of speeding up the digitalisation of businesses and the public administration, according to its website. The partnership with Microsoft will last for seven years and will involve training people in Poland in cloud-based technology.

The focus on clearing carbon from the atmosphere sets Microsoft’s climate goals apart from other corporate pledges which have focused on cutting ongoing emissions or preventing future ones. “If the last decade has taught us anything, it’s that technology built without these principles can do more harm than good,” Chief Executive Satya Nadella said at a media event at Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington.  “We must begin to offset the damaging effects of climate change,” he said, adding if global temperatures continue to rise unabated “the results will be devastating.” The plan includes the creation of a “Climate Innovation Fund,” which will invest $1 billion over the next four years to speed up the development of carbon removal technology.   The announcement by the world’s largest software company reflects the rising profile of U.S. corporate action after President Donald Trump announced in 2017 his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, the global pact to fight climate change. HISTORICAL EMISSIONS A NEW GOAL  Microsoft’s pledge to address its historical emissions may resonate with some developing nations which say countries that created the most carbon, and wealth in the process, are not taking responsibility for their past pollution. U.S. Senators Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, and Mike Braun, an Indiana Republican, applauded Microsoft. “The scope and scale of this proposal is exactly the kind of bold action we need from the business community,” the pair, chairs of the bipartisan Senate Climate Solutions Caucus, said in a statement. Related CoverageFactbox: Big Tech and their carbon pledgesMicrosoft plans to cut carbon emissions by more than half by 2030 across its supply chain, an effort requiring technology that does not fully exist, company President Brad Smith said. He said Microsoft would widen the reach of a fee it has charged its business divisions to account for their carbon emissions. Microsoft said it charges $15 per metric ton for core carbon emissions internally and will expand the coverage in phases to cover all emissions. Microsoft’s price is lower than that for carbon traded in California, where it was $17 per ton in the most recent auction, and the European Union, where it was estimated to trade at 26.57 euros, or $29.58, in the current quarter. CARBON CAPTURE RAISES QUESTIONS Co-founder Bill Gates was an early backer of British Columbia-based Carbon Engineering, among a handful of developers of direct air capture technology. Carbon Engineering CEO Steve Oldham said the firm’s first direct air capture plant is under construction and is expected to capture 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide each year. Microsoft “is at the helm of what could be a new movement towards negative emissions,” Elizabeth V. Sturcken of the Environmental Defense Fund, said in a statement, adding that the nonprofit advocacy group was eager for Microsoft to use its political influence as well. Microsoft’s goal of removing enough carbon by 2050 to account for all its emissions since its founding in 1975 includes direct emissions from sources such as company vehicles and indirect emissions from electricity use. Question remain about the technology that Microsoft is considering. Sue Reid, vice president of climate and energy at U.S. nonprofit Ceres, which works with companies on sustainability commitments, said the economics of direct air capture have yet to be worked out, and reforestation rates may not be fast enough to catch up with growing emissions. “That math is all facing some new uncertainty and vulnerabilities tied to exacerbated climate change impact, (like there being) more wildfires,” she said. Microsoft Chief Environmental Officer Lucas Joppa speaks as the company announces plans to be carbon negative by 2030 and to negate all the direct carbon emissions ever made by the company by 2050 at their campus in Redmond, Washington, U.S., January 16, 2020. REUTERS/Lindsey WassonINVESTORS WANT ACTION ON CLIMATE Microsoft’s announcement comes as big investors pay more attention to how companies tackle climate change. Earlier this week, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said companies must act or face investors’ anger over how unsustainable business practices might curb their future wealth. But even as technology companies have stepped in with climate goal plans, they have faced employee criticism for doing too little. Amazon.com Inc, the world’s largest online retailer, last year pledged to be “net zero carbon” by 2040 and to buy 100,000 electric delivery vans from a startup, after employee activists pushed the retailer to toughen its stance on climate change. Microsoft plans to become net zero carbon a decade earlier than Amazon, although its emissions are roughly a third of Amazon’s. Microsoft expects to release 16 million metric tons of carbon in 2020, including indirect emissions from activities like corporate travel. Amazon, whose cloud business is bigger than Microsoft’s, delivers billions of packages as the largest internet retailer and owns grocer Whole Foods. It emitted more than 44 million metric tons of carbon in 2018, including indirect sources. It was not immediately clear if the figures reported by the companies were exactly comparable. EMPLOYEE ACTIVISTS HIGHLIGHT OIL CONTRACTS Microsoft and Amazon have come under fire from activist tech workers who have demanded that they stop supplying technology to oil and gas companies because of the polluting nature of fossil-fuel extraction. Microsoft in 2017 announced a multi-year deal to sell cloud services to U.S. energy giant Chevron Corp. Slideshow (5 Images)Microsoft Workers 4 Good, which says it represents Microsoft employees aiming to hold the company to its stated values, lauded the climate plan but said “this goal is incompatible with contracts that aim to increase oil extraction, a process which we know is not sustainable.” In a blog post, Microsoft on Thursday reiterated its commitment to working with oil and gas providers, saying it is “imperative that we enable energy companies to transition” to renewable energy and carbon-capture technologies. Bill Weihl, former director of sustainability at Facebook Inc, said Microsoft does not take into account that its work with oil companies could outweigh the gains of measures Microsoft takes on its own carbon reduction. “There is good stuff here,” Weihl said. “But the topline message, that this is urgent, is not matched by what they’re focusing on.” Reporting by Stephen Nellis, Jeffrey Dastin, Dan Levine in San Francisco, Valerie Volcovici in Washington; Editing by Edwina Gibbs, Peter Henderson, Bernadette Baum and Richard ChangOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The focus on clearing carbon from the atmosphere sets Microsoft’s climate goals apart from other corporate pledges which have focused on cutting ongoing emissions or preventing future ones. “If the last decade has taught us anything, it’s that technology built without these principles can do more harm than good,” Chief Executive Satya Nadella said at a media event at Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington.  “We must begin to offset the damaging effects of climate change,” he said, adding if global temperatures continue to rise unabated “the results will be devastating.” The plan includes the creation of a “Climate Innovation Fund,” which will invest $1 billion over the next four years to speed up the development of carbon removal technology.   The announcement by the world’s largest software company reflects the rising profile of U.S. corporate action after President Donald Trump announced in 2017 his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, the global pact to fight climate change. HISTORICAL EMISSIONS A NEW GOAL  Microsoft’s pledge to address its historical emissions may resonate with some developing nations which say countries that created the most carbon, and wealth in the process, are not taking responsibility for their past pollution.

AnyVision, based outside Tel Aviv, has come under scrutiny following reports by Haaretz’s TheMarker business newspaper and NBC News that its technology is used to surveil Palestinians who live in the occupied West Bank. The company had hired former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate the claims.

REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) India-born Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said he was saddened by a new citizenship law based on religion that was recently implemented in his home country, BuzzFeed News reported on Monday.   ""I think what is happening is sad, primarily as sort of someone who grew up there... I think it's just bad,"" Nadella told here BuzzFeed at a Microsoft event in Manhattan.     Nadella grew up in Hyderabad, a technology hub in India that is home to the biggest Microsoft research and development centre outside of the United States.  India’s Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which eases the path for non-Muslims in the neighbouring Muslim-majority nations of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh to gain citizenship, has triggered weeks of sometimes violent protests in the world’s second most populous country. If combined with a proposed national register of citizens, critics of the CAA fear it will discriminate against India’s Muslim minority and chip away at its secular constitution. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The company's India Twitter handle here put out a statement quoting Nadella as saying he was shaped by ""growing up in a multicultural India"" and his ""immigrant experience in the United States"". “My hope is for an India where an immigrant can aspire to found a prosperous start-up or lead a multinational corporation benefitting Indian society and the economy at large.” Nadella and Microsoft were among the top trending topics on Twitter in India.

However, despite online streaming viewership booming under coronavirus lockdowns, Mixer has struggled to leave the shadow of market leader Twitch, owned by Amazon.com Inc.  Even booking popular video game streamer Tyler Blevins, who goes by the online moniker “Ninja”, was not enough for Microsoft to close in on Twitch’s lead. “It became clear that the time needed to grow our own live streaming community to scale was out of measure with the vision and experiences we want to deliver to gamers now, so we’ve decided to close the operations side of Mixer,” Xbox head Phil Spencer said.

The focus on removing existing carbon from the atmosphere sets Microsoft’s climate goals apart from other corporate pledges which have focused on cutting ongoing emissions or preventing future ones. The announcement by the world’s largest software company is the latest in a flurry of climate goals set out by firms after President Donald Trump announced in 2017 his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement, the global pact to fight climate change.

The death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police triggered protests in the United States against racial inequality, while also forcing companies to confront the discrimination that remains prevalent in Corporate America. Earlier in the month, Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google also said that by 2025, the company aims to have 30% more of its leaders from underrepresented groups. Microsoft will take steps to address the needs of other underrepresented communities, including the Hispanic and Latinx community, across the company in the next five years, it said in a blog here post. The company said it will also double the number of Black and African American-owned approved suppliers over the next three years and spend an incremental $500 million with those existing and new suppliers.

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch/FilesMicrosoft struck a 10-year deal with Reliance in 2019, committing to power the oil-to-telecoms conglomerate’s data centres with its Azure cloud. “We’ve been working with Reliance across the entire stack - everything from what they are going to be doing with Azure in their own data centres and how they will extend it,” said India-born Nadella at the event in Mumbai, where he began the first leg of his India tour. “It’s sort of a great example of a business leader and a company which is in very diverse sectors to take a platform approach, to use technology to create more technology.” The executives did not provide specific details about their growth plans.  “We’re very excited about the partnership that Jio (Reliance’s telecoms unit) and Microsoft will have and I think that will be, as we look at this decade, a defining partnership,” Ambani said.

Nadella visits his home country just weeks after telling Buzzfeed News that India’s new citizenship law saddened him and was “just bad”. India’s Citizenship Amendment Act, which paves a way for minorities from neighbouring Muslim-majority nations of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh to gain citizenship, has sparked weeks of protests. Critics say that the law, combined with a proposed national register of citizens, will discriminate against India’s Muslims minority. Nadella, who did not broach political issues at Monday’s event, will also travel to Bengaluru and New Delhi.

REUTERS/Manaure Quintero(Reuters) - ServiceNow Inc and Adobe Inc said on Tuesday they will make their software systems work together in an effort to improve apps used by customer service representatives. ServiceNow has long made software that large businesses use to field internal requests from employees to their information technology departments, but in recent years has branched into selling similar software for use by customer service departments to handle requests from external customers. Adobe, once known for its Photoshop digital imaging software, has shifted to become a major seller of cloud-based software that large businesses use to carry out digital marketing campaigns, giving it data on what consumers like and dislike about a given brand. Under the new partnership, when a customer contacts a brand using the ServiceNow and Adobe systems, the customer service agent will be able to see a profile of the customer, including what they’ve purchased or tried to find help with on a website in the past, pulled together by Adobe. The goal is to better prepare the agent to handle the customer’s request. The deal aims to “address the consumer expectation that wherever I hit that brand, whether it’s through a customer service app, a website or a store, I want them to know me and show me the right experience,” Amit Ahuja, vice president of ecosystem development at Adobe, said in an interview. Michael Ramsey, vice president of product for customer workflows at ServiceNow, said customer service departments can use the additional data to resolve customer requests more quickly. “Consumers want what they want, and they want it now,” he said. Paul Greenberg, managing principal of analyst firm The 56 Group, said the partnership will help both companies. While Adobe has a major partnership with Microsoft Corp to blend its marketing data into Microsoft’s software for sales people, the ServiceNow deal is Adobe’s first big foray into the world of customer service software. And while ServiceNow has experience helping companies route internal requests to the right place, it is relatively new to helping its customer base field questions from external consumers. “They both gain and are both going to be very valuable to each other,” Greenberg said in an interview.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo(Reuters) - Adobe Inc (ADBE.O) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) said on Tuesday they are teaming up to make marketing software easier to use for banks that face strict controls on how customer data must be handled. Banks handle sensitive customer data that is tightly regulated by the U.S. government and simple functions on other websites - such as presenting a form to collect customer data - become more complex when building web pages for functions such as mortgage applications.  The plan is for Adobe’s software to run in IBM’s cloud system that has received regulatory approval for use by banks, the companies said, which will lead to more banking functions becoming totally digital over time. “Even now, for mortgage applications, for example, some of it is on paper, some of it is online,” Anil Chakravarthy, general manager of digital experience for Adobe, said in an interview. “The possibility of being able to handle all of that sensitive data 100% digitally, that’s the possibility that this opens up.” IBM will also be able to connect the cloud-based system to a bank’s internal stores of customer data, which “gives them much more flexibility to pick and choose on the data that they might put into a marketing campaign,” Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president for IBM Global Markets, also said.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo(Reuters) - Adobe Inc (ADBE.O) and International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) said on Tuesday they are teaming up to make marketing software easier to use for banks that face strict controls on how customer data must be handled. Banks handle sensitive customer data that is tightly regulated by the U.S. government and simple functions on other websites - such as presenting a form to collect customer data - become more complex when building web pages for functions such as mortgage applications.  The plan is for Adobe’s software to run in IBM’s cloud system that has received regulatory approval for use by banks, the companies said, which will lead to more banking functions becoming totally digital over time. “Even now, for mortgage applications, for example, some of it is on paper, some of it is online,” Anil Chakravarthy, general manager of digital experience for Adobe, said in an interview. “The possibility of being able to handle all of that sensitive data 100% digitally, that’s the possibility that this opens up.” IBM will also be able to connect the cloud-based system to a bank’s internal stores of customer data, which “gives them much more flexibility to pick and choose on the data that they might put into a marketing campaign,” Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president for IBM Global Markets, also said.

REUTERS/Manaure Quintero(Reuters) - ServiceNow Inc and Adobe Inc said on Tuesday they will make their software systems work together in an effort to improve apps used by customer service representatives. ServiceNow has long made software that large businesses use to field internal requests from employees to their information technology departments, but in recent years has branched into selling similar software for use by customer service departments to handle requests from external customers. Adobe, once known for its Photoshop digital imaging software, has shifted to become a major seller of cloud-based software that large businesses use to carry out digital marketing campaigns, giving it data on what consumers like and dislike about a given brand. Under the new partnership, when a customer contacts a brand using the ServiceNow and Adobe systems, the customer service agent will be able to see a profile of the customer, including what they’ve purchased or tried to find help with on a website in the past, pulled together by Adobe. The goal is to better prepare the agent to handle the customer’s request. The deal aims to “address the consumer expectation that wherever I hit that brand, whether it’s through a customer service app, a website or a store, I want them to know me and show me the right experience,” Amit Ahuja, vice president of ecosystem development at Adobe, said in an interview. Michael Ramsey, vice president of product for customer workflows at ServiceNow, said customer service departments can use the additional data to resolve customer requests more quickly. “Consumers want what they want, and they want it now,” he said. Paul Greenberg, managing principal of analyst firm The 56 Group, said the partnership will help both companies. While Adobe has a major partnership with Microsoft Corp to blend its marketing data into Microsoft’s software for sales people, the ServiceNow deal is Adobe’s first big foray into the world of customer service software. And while ServiceNow has experience helping companies route internal requests to the right place, it is relatively new to helping its customer base field questions from external consumers. “They both gain and are both going to be very valuable to each other,” Greenberg said in an interview.

The company’s shares were up 2.7% in trading after the bell. In a cloud market dominated by application software providers such as Microsoft Corp and Salesforce.com Inc , Adobe has carved a niche for its creativity and design-related software offerings such as Photoshop and Illustrator. Revenue from its digital media unit rose about 22% to $2.08 billion in the quarter, edging past estimates of $2.05 billion according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company’s net income rose to $851.9 million, or $1.74 per share, in the quarter ended Nov. 29, from $678.2 million, or $1.37 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Adobe earned $2.29 per share. Analysts, on average, had expected $2.26 per share. The company, however, forecast first-quarter revenue of $3.04 billion below Wall Street expectations of $3.09 billion, as it faces intense competition in a fast-growing cloud market, which is expected to grow to $266.4 billion in 2020, according to a report here by Statista. Total quarterly revenue rose about 21% to $2.99 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of $2.97 billion.

In doing so, Adobe, known for its image-editing software Photoshop, partnered with Microsoft in March to bolster its sales and marketing software capabilities. Salesforce and Microsoft also posted better-than-expected quarterly results on the back of growth in their cloud businesses. Adobe’s shift to a cloud-based subscription has brought a more predictable revenue stream for the company, by selling its software through web-based subscriptions and not through the sale of packaged-licensed software. On Tuesday, Adobe’s executives expressed confidence in the company’s ability to raise prices annually for its subscription-based services, while driving volume growth by attracting new users. “We’re able to do that through the various new products that are attracting folks to our platform... And then as they get comfortable with those, they end up to upsell them into full suite products for multiple applications,” Chief Financial Officer John Murphy on post-earnings call. Subscription revenue during the second quarter jumped 27.7% to $2.46 billion and product revenue rose 1.2% to $152.8 million. Revenue from Adobe’s digital media segment jumped 22% to $1.89 billion, above estimates of $1.86 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue from its Experience Cloud business, which provides services including analytics, advertising and marketing, rose 34% to $784 million, above analysts’ estimate of $774.9 million. The growth was helped by the acquisitions of Magento and Marketo, Chief Executive Officer Shantanu Narayen said on the call.

Revenue rose 1.7 percent to $1.045 billion in its fiscal first quarter ended March 2, slightly below the $1.054 billion average forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales at the digital media unit, which produces Adobe’s widely used Creative Suite, fell 4 percent from a year earlier to $730 million. Creative Suite includes popular design titles Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Flash and Dreamweaver. Chief Financial Officer Mark Garret said on a conference call that Creative Suite revenue lagged the company’s expectations because customers are waiting to buy two new versions set to be introduced at the end of the current quarter: Creative Suite 6 and a Web-based version of the suite that will be sold via subscription. Analysts are increasingly concerned that the Web-based subscription service, known as Creative Cloud, will hurt Adobe’s financial growth over the short term. Adobe’s sales typically surge after a Creative Suite upgrade, but analysts have said the revenue upswing might be smaller than in the past because customers who switch to the new service won’t buy their software up front. Instead they will enter into subscription agreements to rent the software, making much lower initial payments. They will get extra features such as document storage at Adobe data centers and frequent updates. Global equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry said it could take several quarters for revenue and profit growth to return to normal after the launch of the new products. “I think the stock goes sideways for another couple of quarters,” he said. The software maker also reported a first-quarter profit, excluding one-time items, of 57 cents per share, matching the average analyst forecast. Adobe said it expects to post second-quarter revenue of $1.090 billion to $1.140 billion, compared with the average analyst forecast of $1.1 billion. It forecast second-quarter profit, excluding items, of 57 to 61 cents per share, compared to the Street view of 60 cents. Shares of Adobe closed at $34.51 on Nasdaq and fell 4.8 percent to $32.84 in extended trading.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoAdobe and Microsoft hope to make it easier for users of Adobe’s marketing software to find and target teams of potential customers for business goods on LinkedIn, the social network owned by Microsoft, they said at a conference in Las Vegas.   If an Adobe customer is selling medical equipment to a hospital, for example, the new partnership would make it easier to target tailored LinkedIn ads to all of the people involved in the purchasing decision, such as doctors, technicians and finance managers. If the marketing campaign works, sales people could then use Microsoft’s sales software to help close the deal. “The LinkedIn network is one of those clear holy grails” for business marketers, Steve Lucas, senior vice president of digital experience at Adobe and former chief executive officer of Marketo, a business-to-business marketing software firm that Adobe acquired last year for $4.75 billion, told Reuters. “It has just become such a huge lever for B-to-B marketers that it would be impossible for us to ignore it.” Long known as the maker of content creation tools such as Photoshop, Adobe has in recent years turned to making the software used for marketing campaigns, which rely heavily on the content created with its software. Most of Adobe’s tools were for marketers trying to reach consumers, but the Marketo acquisition last year bolstered its software for business marketers. While Microsoft is best known for its Window operating system and Office program, it is also working to grow a business called Dynamics 365, software used by sales people to track deals. Its $26 billion acquisition in 2016 of LinkedIn, perhaps the most common tool used by sales people trying to drum up  business, was a key piece of the effort. In doing so, both are taking on Salesforce, the cloud software company that offers sales and marketing software, where Adobe and Microsoft lack one or the other. But by integrating their systems, Adobe and Microsoft can offer something arguably “a lot broader” because Adobe software is how most marketing content gets made, said Melissa Webster, program vice president for content and digital media technologies at research firm IDC. “There’s no question that Microsoft and Adobe both have a lot to gain from teaming up against Salesforce,” Webster said.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoAdobe and Microsoft hope to make it easier for users of Adobe’s marketing software to find and target teams of potential customers for business goods on LinkedIn, the social network owned by Microsoft, they said at a conference in Las Vegas.   If an Adobe customer is selling medical equipment to a hospital, for example, the new partnership would make it easier to target tailored LinkedIn ads to all of the people involved in the purchasing decision, such as doctors, technicians and finance managers. If the marketing campaign works, sales people could then use Microsoft’s sales software to help close the deal. “The LinkedIn network is one of those clear holy grails” for business marketers, Steve Lucas, senior vice president of digital experience at Adobe and former chief executive officer of Marketo, a business-to-business marketing software firm that Adobe acquired last year for $4.75 billion, told Reuters. “It has just become such a huge lever for B-to-B marketers that it would be impossible for us to ignore it.” Long known as the maker of content creation tools such as Photoshop, Adobe has in recent years turned to making the software used for marketing campaigns, which rely heavily on the content created with its software. Most of Adobe’s tools were for marketers trying to reach consumers, but the Marketo acquisition last year bolstered its software for business marketers. While Microsoft is best known for its Window operating system and Office program, it is also working to grow a business called Dynamics 365, software used by sales people to track deals. Its $26 billion acquisition in 2016 of LinkedIn, perhaps the most common tool used by sales people trying to drum up  business, was a key piece of the effort. In doing so, both are taking on Salesforce, the cloud software company that offers sales and marketing software, where Adobe and Microsoft lack one or the other. But by integrating their systems, Adobe and Microsoft can offer something arguably “a lot broader” because Adobe software is how most marketing content gets made, said Melissa Webster, program vice president for content and digital media technologies at research firm IDC. “There’s no question that Microsoft and Adobe both have a lot to gain from teaming up against Salesforce,” Webster said. Salesforce could not be reached immediately for comment.

Shares of Adobe rose about 1 percent in extended trading after the Photoshop maker also said it would buy back up to $8 billion of shares through its fiscal year 2021. Adobe said the deal will help bolster its Experience Cloud business, which provides services including analytics, advertising and marketing. “Adobe is the only company with leadership in content creation, marketing, advertising, analytics and now commerce – enabling real-time experiences across the entire customer journey,” Brad Rencher, an executive vice president and general manager at Adobe, said in a statement.  Magento was acquired by Permira from eBay Inc in 2015 and counts Canon, Helly Hansen, Paul Smith and Rosetta Stone among its clients.  “Magento has grown its customer-base and enterprise cloud business as a result of key investments in technology, marketing, client success, sales management and the open-source community ecosystem,” Phil Guinand, partner at Permira, said in a statement.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking(Reuters) - Adobe Systems Inc, maker of Photoshop and Acrobat software, has appointed three new members from technology and media companies to its board of directors. The company said on Monday that it added Cisco Systems Inc chief financial officer Frank Calderoni, Comcast Venture’s managing director, Amy Banse, and Laura Desmond, global head of the Starcom MediaVest Group, to the board. That raises the number of board members to 12 from 9, the company said. “Amy Banse, Frank Calderoni and Laura Desmond bring deep expertise in media and technology to our board, which are critical to our mission of being the category leader in digital media and digital marketing,” John Warnock and Chuck Geschke, co-chairmen of the Adobe board said in a statement. Adobe, the biggest maker of design software, reported slower first quarter revenue growth in March as sales of its widely used Creative Suite software fell, missing its forecasts, ahead of widely anticipated product launches. Analysts are increasingly concerned the Web-based subscription service, known as Creative Cloud, will hurt Adobe’s financial growth over at least the short term. In November, Adobe said it planned to lay off more than 7 percent of its workforce and take a charge of up to $94 million as part of a restructuring to focus on core businesses such as digital media and marketing.

REUTERS/Rick Wilking(Reuters) - Adobe Systems Inc, maker of Photoshop and Acrobat software, has appointed three new members from technology and media companies to its board of directors. The company said on Monday that it added Cisco Systems Inc chief financial officer Frank Calderoni, Comcast Venture’s managing director, Amy Banse, and Laura Desmond, global head of the Starcom MediaVest Group, to the board. That raises the number of board members to 12 from 9, the company said. “Amy Banse, Frank Calderoni and Laura Desmond bring deep expertise in media and technology to our board, which are critical to our mission of being the category leader in digital media and digital marketing,” John Warnock and Chuck Geschke, co-chairmen of the Adobe board said in a statement. Adobe, the biggest maker of design software, reported slower first quarter revenue growth in March as sales of its widely used Creative Suite software fell, missing its forecasts, ahead of widely anticipated product launches. Analysts are increasingly concerned the Web-based subscription service, known as Creative Cloud, will hurt Adobe’s financial growth over at least the short term. In November, Adobe said it planned to lay off more than 7 percent of its workforce and take a charge of up to $94 million as part of a restructuring to focus on core businesses such as digital media and marketing.

Adobe company logos are seen in this picture illustration taken in Vienna July 9, 2013. REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger The Photoshop maker said it expects full-year revenue of about $5.7 billion and an adjusted profit of $2.70 per share.  Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $5.93 billion and earnings of $3.19 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In 2013, Adobe forecast an adjusted profit of $3 per share for 2016.  The company is expecting a $200 million hit on revenue as a result of the stronger dollar, and a $100 million hit as Adobe’s “last material businesses are transitioning to ratable revenue.” Adobe has been switching to web-based subscriptions from traditional licensed software to help attract more predictable recurring revenue. Acrobat, Elements and Lightroom are among the last of the products to transition to web-based subscription. “It looks like the ramp of the business is going to be moving more slowly going forward,” FBR Capital Markets & Co analyst Samad Samana said. Creative Cloud, which includes Photoshop, Illustrator and Indexing, is the biggest of the company’s cloud businesses. The other two are Marketing Cloud and Document Cloud. The company, which is generally conservative with its forecast, expects 20 percent growth in revenue in its Digital Media business, which includes Creative Cloud, and the Marketing Cloud segment in 2016. Adobe forecast fourth-quarter revenue and profit below estimates in September, despite adding more subscribers for its Creative Cloud software suite than analysts had expected. The company’s shares were down at $82.00 after closing at $85.15 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday, recouping early losses.

Analysts on average were expecting an adjusted profit of 31 share on revenue of $1.09 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “I think the market has come to expect perfection from this company and today was not perfect,” Edward Jones technology analyst Josh Olson told Reuters. Revenue from Adobe’s digital media business, which includes the Creative Cloud and document services, fell about 2.4 percent to $621.4 million in the third quarter ended Aug. 29.

He added that Adobe had achieved a lot of the “low-hanging fruit” in shifting its existing customer base to the cloud, but the challenge now was to convince the more “resistant” customers, such as small businesses and individuals.

Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen speaks at the Samsung keynote address on the opening day of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas January 6, 2011. REUTERS/Rick WilkingAdobe reported third quarter earnings of 58 cents per share, in line with estimates, and said in the current quarter EPS, excluding items, will range from 53 cents to 58 cents a share on revenue of $1.075 billion to $1.125 billion. That’s below analysts’ average estimate of fourth-quarter EPS of 67 cents per share on revenue of $1.2 billion, according to equity research firm StarMine, which gives more weight to estimates from analysts with a better track record. These targeted ranges factor in 25,000 additional new Creative Cloud subscriptions in the quarter, the company said on Wednesday. Adobe launched its Creative Suite 6 - which includes Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Flash and Dreamweaver - and the Web-based Creative Cloud products in the second quarter aimed at providing a more stable revenue model. Analysts have expressed concern that the Web-based subscription service will hurt Adobe’s financial growth at least over the short term. Fourth-quarter targets indicate that Adobe’s transition is happening faster than anticipated, Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said. “What happens with the subscription model is that revenue is recognized over time, so if adoption is faster there is more of a delay,” he said. “The long term take away is that it’s good thing.” Net income for the third quarter was $201.3 million. Revenue of $1.08 billion came below Wall Street expectations of $1.10 billion due to a currency hit of about $9 million. Adobe shares fell 0.7 percent in after hours trading to $32.90, after closing up 1.69 percent at $33.12.

The company said on Monday that it added Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) chief financial officer Frank Calderoni, Comcast Venture’s (CMCSA.O) managing director, Amy Banse, and Laura Desmond, global head of the Starcom MediaVest Group, to the board. That raises the number of board members to 12 from 9, the company said. “Amy Banse, Frank Calderoni and Laura Desmond bring deep expertise in media and technology to our board, which are critical to our mission of being the category leader in digital media and digital marketing,” John Warnock and Chuck Geschke, co-chairmen of the Adobe board said in a statement. Adobe, the biggest maker of design software, reported slower first quarter revenue growth in March as sales of its widely used Creative Suite software fell, missing its forecasts, ahead of widely anticipated product launches. Analysts are increasingly concerned the Web-based subscription service, known as Creative Cloud, will hurt Adobe’s financial growth over at least the short term. In November, Adobe said it planned to lay off more than 7 percent of its workforce and take a charge of up to $94 million as part of a restructuring to focus on core businesses such as digital media and marketing.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo(Reuters) - Adobe Systems Inc said on Monday it would buy e-commerce services provider Magento Commerce from private equity firm Permira for $1.68 billion in cash, its biggest deal in nearly a decade. Shares of Adobe rose about 1 percent in extended trading after the Photoshop maker also said it would buy back up to $8 billion of shares through its fiscal year 2021. Adobe said the deal will help bolster its Experience Cloud business, which provides services including analytics, advertising and marketing. “Adobe is the only company with leadership in content creation, marketing, advertising, analytics and now commerce – enabling real-time experiences across the entire customer journey,” Brad Rencher, an executive vice president and general manager at Adobe, said in a statement.  Magento was acquired by Permira from eBay Inc in 2015 and counts Canon, Helly Hansen, Paul Smith and Rosetta Stone among its clients.  “Magento has grown its customer-base and enterprise cloud business as a result of key investments in technology, marketing, client success, sales management and the open-source community ecosystem,” Phil Guinand, partner at Permira, said in a statement. Magento also shares customers including Coca-Cola, Warner Music Group, Nestle and Cathay Pacific with Adobe, the company said.  The transaction is expected to close during Adobe’s fiscal third quarter. Qatalyst Partners acted as financial adviser to Permira, and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson acted as legal adviser.

Adobe company logos are seen in this picture illustration taken in Vienna July 9, 2013. REUTERS/Leonhard FoegerThe company’s shares rose about 8 percent after initially falling 5 percent in extended trading. Adobe added 402,000 subscribers for Creative Cloud, which includes Photoshop, Illustrator and Flash, in the fourth quarter, up from the 331,000 it added in the third quarter. “Investors are giving Adobe’s management team credit for its progress despite the light profit to this point, and will likely continue to do so, as long as the number of new cloud subscribers continue to outpace expectations,” Edward Jones’ technology analyst Josh Olson told Reuters. The company said in September it expects subscriber growth for Creative Cloud to top 331,000 due to strong demand from corporate customers. Adobe has been shifting to web-based subscription service Creative Cloud from a licensing model since last year. Subscription models bring in less money upfront as payment is spread over the entire period of use unlike traditional packaged software, but typically ensure more predictable recurring revenue. Adobe said it expects revenue of $950 million to $1 billion in the first quarter. The company forecast adjusted earnings of 22 cents to 28 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 34 cents per share on revenue of $1.02 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s net income fell to $65.32 million, or 13 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended November 29, from $222.3 million, or 44 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 32 cents per share, in line with analysts’ estimate. Revenue fell 9.6 percent to $1.04 billion, slightly above the estimated $1.03 billion.

About 52 percent of customers subscribe to the highest-priced full Creative Cloud while the rest subscribe to individual products. Of those, Photoshop Lightroom was the fastest growing, Chief Financial Officer Mark Garrett said in an interview. “It’s growing the most because it’s attracting new users ... hobbyists and consumers and people that would never buy the Creative products before, so it’s expanded our market opportunity,” Garrett said.

Adobe’s shares jumped 4.7 percent to $93.10 in extended trading on Thursday and are set to hit a record high on Friday. The company said 833,000 subscribers signed up for Creative Cloud in the fourth quarter ended Nov. 27, more than the 678,200 additions analysts were expecting, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount. Creative Cloud includes graphic design tool Photoshop, web design software Dreamweaver and web video building application Flash, among other software. Adobe, which has seen strong growth from Creative Cloud, has been nimble enough to attract users other than enterprises and professionals to the software suite. About 52 percent of customers subscribe to the highest-priced full Creative Cloud while the rest subscribe to individual products. Of those, Photoshop Lightroom was the fastest growing, Chief Financial Officer Mark Garrett said in an interview. “It’s growing the most because it’s attracting new users ... hobbyists and consumers and people that would never buy the Creative products before, so it’s expanded our market opportunity,” Garrett said.     San Jose-based Adobe has been switching to web-based subscriptions from traditional licensed software to enjoy a more predictable recurring revenue stream. “(Adobe has) largely completed this transition to a recurrent revenue model. You are starting to see revenue stack even though your expenses aren’t rising as quickly,” said FBR Capital Markets analyst Samad Samana.     Revenue from its digital media business, which houses Creative Cloud, jumped 35 percent to $875.3 million. The business – also home to Acrobat, which enables the ubiquitous PDF format for e-books – makes up the bulk of Adobe’s revenue. Revenue from its digital marketing business, which offers tools for businesses to analyze customer interactions and manage social media content, rose 2.3 percent to $382.7 million. Total revenue rose to $1.31 billion. Despite the 21.7 percent increase in fourth-quarter revenue only matching analysts’ estimates, a much lower 3.4 percent bump in total operating costs also helped Adobe’s profit beat estimates.

He added that the two events posed different challenges for delivering live events to people who want to watch on smartphones and other mobile devices. “The Olympics take place over several weeks and about one billion people will want to watch the Super Bowl for four hours.” Adobe, the world’s largest maker of design software, in March announced its Adobe Media Server 5 that also allowed streaming video on devices such as the iPad. Wadhwani, who was speaking at Reuters Global Media and Technology Summit in New York, said Adobe is working with multiple partners to help insert advertisements into the live streaming of the Games. “I think the bigger revenue opportunity around video is advertising,” he said but declined to name any partners. Companies such as NBC Universal, BBC and Google Inc’s YouTube have announced that they will stream the Olympics live. NBC has said it will offer the service in the United State and the BBC will stream the event in the UK. YouTube has said it agreed with the International Olympic Committee to broadcast the event in 64 territories across Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Apart from Adobe, content delivery networks such as Akamai or Limelight will benefit from live streaming as well. Asked how Adobe had prepared for the events, Wadhwani said that the company had set up environments on a micro scale, then tried to replicate them. “This will not only test our technology, but also the global infrastructure to support it,” he said. He added that he was optimistic: “We held up reasonably well on (President Barack) Obama’s inauguration.” Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo  (Reuters) - Photoshop maker Adobe Systems Inc (ADBE.O) on Monday lifted its adjusted profit forecast for the current quarter and the full year, saying it expects its effective tax rate to decline “substantially” due to the recently enacted U.S. tax reforms. Adobe said it expects a charge of about $85 million in the current quarter related to taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings and remeasuring deferred tax assets, and a tax rate of 17 percent compared with its previous target of about 9 percent. But the company raised its current-quarter adjusted profit forecast, which will exclude the charge, to $1.43 per share from $1.27 per share. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.27 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Adobe said it expects a charge of about $85 million in the current quarter related to taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings and remeasuring deferred tax assets, and a tax rate of 17 percent compared with its previous target of about 9 percent. But the company raised its current-quarter adjusted profit forecast, which will exclude the charge, to $1.43 per share from $1.27 per share.

Revenue rose 1.7 percent to $1.045 billion in its fiscal first quarter ended March 2, slightly below the $1.054 billion average forecast of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales at the digital media unit, which produces Adobe’s widely used Creative Suite, fell 4 percent from a year earlier to $730 million. Creative Suite includes popular design titles Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Flash and Dreamweaver. Chief Financial Officer Mark Garrett said on a conference call that Creative Suite revenue lagged the company’s expectations because customers are waiting to buy two new versions set to be introduced at the end of the current quarter: Creative Suite 6 and a Web-based version of the suite that will be sold via subscription. Analysts are increasingly concerned the Web-based subscription service, known as Creative Cloud, will hurt Adobe’s financial growth over at least the short term. “I think there are going to be some surprises along the way. These things tend to take longer and be tougher than managements expect,” said JMP Securities Analyst Pat Walravens. Adobe’s sales typically surge after a Creative Suite upgrade, but analysts have said the revenue upswing might be smaller than in the past because customers who switch to the new service will not buy their software up front. Instead they will enter into subscription agreements to rent the software, making much lower initial payments. They will get extra features such as document storage at Adobe data centers and frequent updates. Global equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry said it could take several quarters for revenue and profit growth to return to normal after the launch of the new products. “I think the stock goes sideways for another couple of quarters,” he said. Company executives said during an analyst conference call they intend to promote the subscription service as the superior offering. They said it could take a while to persuade a significant percentage of its corporate customers to move to the new service, but did not specify just how long that might be. “People are going to want to see the product; understand what we can offer,” Garrett said in response to one of several questions about the new service during the analyst call. “It’s going to take a little bit of time.” The software maker also reported a first-quarter profit, excluding one-time items, of 57 cents per share, matching the average analyst forecast. Adobe expects to post second-quarter revenue of $1.090 billion to $1.140 billion, compared with the average analyst forecast of $1.1 billion. It forecast second-quarter profit, excluding items, of 57 to 61 cents per share, compared with the Street view of 60 cents. Adobe shares closed at $34.51 on Nasdaq and fell 4.5 percent to $32.96 in extended trading.

Adobe’s shares rose 8.6 percent in after-hours trading. “These results reflect Adobe is continuing to execute well through its transition to the cloud, which continues to be a key ingredient in the company’s long-term recipe for success,” FBR Capital Markets analyst Samad Samana told Reuters. Adobe said in March it would phase out the traditional box license versions of its Creative Suite 6 and offer the software only on a web-based subscription model.  Subscription models bring in less money upfront, but they usually ensure more predictable recurring revenue. Adobe said it added 464,000 paid Creative Cloud subscribers in the second quarter ended May 30, ending the quarter with 2.3 million paid subscribers. The company said it expects to have 3.3 million subscribers of its Creative Cloud suite at the end of fiscal 2014, up from its earlier forecast of 3 million. Creative Cloud suite includes Photoshop, Illustrator and Flash software. FBR Capital’s Samana said Adobe’s strong uptick in net new subscriber additions indicates that customers are increasingly seeing the value of the Creative Cloud offering, the engine of growth for the company’s digital media business. “All key metrics were above consensus and the company’s transition to subscriptions is proceeding well ahead of plan,” Deutsche Bank analyst Nandan Amladi told Reuters. The company offers Creative Cloud and document services under its digital media unit, while its digital marketing unit offers marketing analytics tools, document management and web conferencing software. Digital media revenue rose 3 percent to $691.6 million In the second quarter, while digital marketing revenue rose 16 percent to $330.3 million. The company said it expects marketing cloud revenue to grow about 20 percent this year, from a year earlier. The company forecast an adjusted profit of 22-28 cents per share on revenue of $975 million to $1.025 billion for the current quarter. (r.reuters.com/zex22w) Analysts were expecting an adjusted profit of 27 cents per share on revenue of $1.018 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s net income rose to $88.5 million, or 17 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $76.5 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding items, the company earned 37 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 30 cents per share. Revenue rose about 6 percent to $1.07 billion. Analysts on average had expected $1.03 billion. Creative annualized recurring revenue more than tripled to $1.2 billion. The company’s shares were at $73.30 in extended trading after closing at $67.54 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday. The stock has gained 13 percent in the year so far.

Launched on Tuesday, Adobe Stock is a repackaged version of Fotolia, which Adobe bought in January. The company is offering the product at a significant discount to users of its Creative Cloud suite, which houses the popular Photoshop and Illustrator tools. It will also be available as a standalone service. But analysts said it would not be easy to lure customers away from Shutterstock and the product may even be a hard sell to existing Creative Cloud users, at least in the near term. “I think that Creative Cloud users could potentially experiment with Adobe Stock, but I don’t think that the content is there right now for them to switch over,” Topeka Capital Markets analyst Blake Harper said. For one, Adobe Stock needs to boost its inventory. It offers 40 million images, while Shutterstock has a gallery of over 56 million images. “I think the magnitude of the lead that Shutterstock has is kind of under-appreciated,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Rohit Kulkarni told Reuters. Getty, one of the oldest in the game, offers more than 25 million images under its iStock brand, apart from other royalty free images. The company boasts a total inventory of over 100 million images and serves a large editorial clientele. Adobe’s entry could unsettle Getty, which is struggling with financial problems and has been discounting to retain users. Topeka’s Harper said Adobe would also need to sort out the “bad blood” between Fotolia’s management and U.S. contributors over payments. Analysts have said Adobe Stock needs more variety, especially U.S. content, as Fotolia was more popular in Europe. PRICING WARS The key to winning the war could be pricing. Adobe Stock’s annual subscription of 750 images is priced at $199.99 per month, a dollar more than Shutterstock’s “professional” package. Getty’s premium iStock photos cost $333.25 per month, while a cheaper collection costs $166.58. It will take time for Adobe to gain critical mass, and meanwhile Shutterstock could lower prices to attract new customers, Morningstar analyst Norman Young said. Still, Adobe is confident that it will be able to take a “big share” of the $3-billion total available market, the company’s Chief Financial Officer Mark Garrett told Reuters. Adobe expects $75 million in revenue from Adobe Stock this year. Shutterstock’s CEO and founder, Jon Oringer, declined to comment on whether the company expects Adobe Stock’s launch to alter market dynamics. Getty declined to comment.

The European Commission said its investigation would look into Apple’s requirement forcing app developers to sell to customers using its own in-app purchase system and rules preventing them from informing users of cheaper products elsewhere. The investigation will also cover all apps which compete with Apple in Europe, which could be icloud and gaming apps, following informal information received by regulators. The probe followed Swedish music streaming service Spotify’s complaint last year, which said Apple was unfairly restricting rivals to its own music steaming service Apple Music. Another gripe was the 30% fee levied on app developers. Spotify welcomed the EU move. A smaller rival filed a similar grievance related to e-books and audiobooks in March this year. “It appears that Apple obtained a ‘gatekeeper’ role when it comes to the distribution of apps and content to users of Apple’s popular devices,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. The second case focuses on Apple’s terms and conditions on how its mobile payment service Apple Pay should be used in merchants’ apps and websites, and also the company’s refusal to allow rivals access to the payment system. Regulators are also concerned that Apple Pay, launched in 2014 as the company diversified from sales of devices like iPhones and iPads, is the only mobile payment service allowed to use the “tap and go” functionality on iPhones.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Tuesday said it would expand its App Store, Apple Music and other services to dozens of new markets in Africa, the Middle East and beyond in the biggest geographical expansion of its services in almost a decade. Apple said it would expand the App Store to 20 countries, eight of them in Africa, and will offer its streaming Apple Music service in 52 additional countries and regions. The expansion is the largest since Apple grew what was then called the iTunes Store to India, Russia and more than 50 other countries in 2012. Apple has focused on growing sales from its services segment, which totaled 17.8% of its $260.1 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year, as consumers have slowed in upgrading their smart phones. Apple executives said in January that the company had an installed base of 1.5 billion active devices and aimed to reach 600 million subscribers to either its own or third-party services by the end of this year. Apple’s biggest services revenue generator is the App Store, where it keeps a cut of between 15% and 30% of sales. In Africa, the store will expand to Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Libya, Morocco, Rwanda and Zambia. It will also become available in the Maldives and Myanmar in the Asia-Pacific region, Afghanistan and Iraq in the Middle East, and several nations in the Balkans and Oceania, for a total of 175 countries. The company is also expanding its Apple Music service, bringing the total to 167 markets. Apple’s top streaming rival, Spotify Technology SA (SPOT.N), operates in 79 countries. Apple will have different terms and pricing for streaming music in the new markets. In the United States, Apple offers a three-month free trial and charges individual users $9.99 a month thereafter. In the new markets, Apple will  offer a six-month trial period and adjust monthly prices Ivory Coast and Myanmar, and $4.99 in markets such as Iraq and Kuwait.

It said the investigation was aimed at establishing whether Apple and Amazon had reached an agreement against market rules to prevent electronic retailers not included in Apple’s official programme selling the products online. According to the watchdog, the alleged behaviour could have created barriers to entry, affecting competition on prices. The Italian competition authority said in a statement that its officials searched Amazon and Apple offices in Italy on Tuesday.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoDUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner (DPC), Apple’s main regulator in the European Union, on Thursday said it was in contact with the company after a whistleblower called for action  over a programme that listens to users’ recordings. The regulator acted after Thomas Le Bonniec, a former Apple contractor, wrote to European data protection regulators on May 20 to push for investigations into these practices. “The DPC engaged with Apple on this issue when it first arose last summer and Apple has since made some changes,” Graham Doyle, Deputy Commissioner at the Irish DPC, said in an emailed statement to Reuters.  “However, we have followed up again with Apple following the release of this public statement and await responses,” he said, in reference to the letter. “In addition, it should be noted that the European Data Protection Board is working on the production of guidance in the area of voice assistant technologies.” Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Apple said last year it would quit its default practice of retaining audio recordings of the requests users make to its Siri personal assistant and limit human review of what audio it does collect to its own employees rather than contractors. Le Bonniec’s letter, seen by Reuters, which was published on Thursday, said in reference to EU data protection laws: “Passing a law is not good enough: it needs to be enforced upon privacy offenders.” Le Bonniec worked as a subcontractor for Apple in its Irish offices, he said in the letter.

Apple said last year it would quit its default practice of retaining audio recordings of the requests users make to its Siri personal assistant and limit human review of what audio it does collect to its own employees rather than contractors. Le Bonniec’s letter, seen by Reuters, which was published on Thursday, said in reference to EU data protection laws: “Passing a law is not good enough: it needs to be enforced upon privacy offenders.” Le Bonniec worked as a subcontractor for Apple in its Irish offices, he said in the letter.

LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Big Tech investors have historically brushed off the threat from Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s antitrust tzar who wants to reduce U.S. behemoths’ digital dominance. The combined market value of Apple, Amazon.com, Facebook and Google owner Alphabet has risen more than threefold to $4.4 trillion since the Dane’s first term started in 2014. Two new probes into Apple, launched on Tuesday, suggest that it’s time to start taking her more seriously. Vestager is concerned that the rules for Apple’s preponderant app store distort competition. Music-streaming rival Spotify Technology complained that Apple levies a 30% “tax” on purchases made within apps by smartphone users, while simultaneously stopping app developers from steering customers to cheaper options. The second probe centres on Apple Pay, which allows customers to buy things using an iPhone. Vestager worries that Apple makes it hard for competing payments systems to work smoothly with its popular smartphones. Apple said it was disappointed that the European Commission “is advancing baseless complaints from a handful of companies who simply want a free ride”.  But Chief Executive Tim Cook – and the company’s investors – should be worried. The smartphone market is mature, and that’s a problem for Apple, as it accounts for roughly half of revenue. Sales of iPhone handsets fell 7% in the first quarter of 2020. Apple has compensated by selling more apps, and subscriptions to its gaming and music services. These services are closing in on a quarter of all revenue thanks to rapid growth. Citi analysts reckon that the app store accounts for 30% of all services revenue. That has convinced the market to revalue Apple, as investors prefer recurring services revenue to one-off hardware sales. The company’s shares are valued at 24 times estimated earnings over the next 12 months, using Refinitiv data. That’s nearly twice as high as the multiple from 2015 until the end of 2018. If the commission forces Apple to cut App Store fees and promote competing systems to Apple Pay, its revenue growth would slow, probably meriting a lower multiple, and jeopardising its $1.5 trillion market capitalisation. In other words, Vestager is getting serious – unlike with past probes into Google’s shopping website and Android operating system, which made little difference to the company’s core business. Cook’s shareholders, and those in other tech behemoths, ought to be worried.BreakingviewsReuters Breakingviews is the world's leading source of agenda-setting financial insight.

FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File PhotoThe iPhone maker made the surprise announcement in its quarterly report, saying it will split its stock four-to-one when trading opens on Aug. 31, Apple’s first share split since 2014. Stock splits have become rare on Wall Street in recent years, with just three S&P 500 members announcing splits in 2020, compared to an average of 10 a year over the past decade, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Splitting their stocks is a way for companies to make it less expensive to buy individual shares, potentially attracting retail investors who make small trades.   Amazon’s shares cost $3,051 each, while an Alphabet share sells for $1,538 and Chipotle Mexican Grill’s shares cost $1,148. With Apple’s stock surging 6% in extended trade to $408 following its strong quarterly report, the split means shareholders will receive three shares for every one that they own. Investors will be able to buy shares for closer to $100 each. Apple said it hoped to make the shares “more accessible to a broader base of investors.”  However, brokerages increasingly let customers buy parts of shares, making the benefit of share splits less clear than in the past.  “Stock splits have become far and few between because people no longer care if it’s a $500 or $100 stock, because investors can now buy fractions of shares,” said Howard Silverblatt,  senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. Splitting Apple’s shares means the Silicon Valley company will have less influence within the Dow, which is weighted to the price of the shares of its 30 components.  Apple was added to the Dow in 2015, and the 230% gain in Apple’s stock since then has been a major factor driving gains in the Dow, widely viewed as a reflection of the U.S. stock market. Apple currently accounts for about 10% of the Dow, and after the share split, it will make up only a quarter of that, ranking it the 18th most heavily weighted stock in the Dow. Potential future gains and losses in Apple’s stock will have less influence in the Dow’s performance.  Apple's stock split will not affect its weight within the S&P 500 .SPX, which is based on market capitalization.

Apple shares are virtually flat year-to-date, compared with a 12% drop in the S&P 500 Index.  The technology company raised $8.5 billion by selling four different bonds with maturities ranging from three years to 30 years. It sold a $2 billion three-year bond and a five-year $2.25 billion with coupons of 0.75% and 1.125% respectively, the lowest rates the company has paid on bonds with such durations since 2013, according to Refinitiv IFR data.  The coupons on Apple’s 10-year and 30-year bonds were also the lowest the company has paid in the past years, according to the Refinitiv data. The funds will go toward general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and dividend payments, Apple said in a regulatory filing. During the six months ended March 28, Apple spent $38.5 billion to repurchase its own stock.  The Fed slashed interest rates to almost zero in March and said it would act as buyer of last resort in the investment-grade corporate bond market, in a bid to help cash-strapped companies access capital markets roiled by the economic fallout from the pandemic.  While the Federal Reserve has yet to buy a single corporate bond, the intervention has fueled record issuance by companies in need of funding, such as Boeing Co, Marriott International Inc and Ford Motor Co. The policy has also allowed financially strong companies such as Apple, which had just over $40 billion in cash as of the end of March, to reduce its cost of capital to the benefit of shareholders. In the past week, drugmaker Biogen Inc and U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc have also sold new bonds at low rates, which the companies said were partly to fund share buybacks.

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoDUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner (DPC), Apple’s main regulator in the European Union, on Thursday said it was in contact with the company after a whistleblower called for action  over a programme that listens to users’ recordings. The regulator acted after Thomas Le Bonniec, a former Apple contractor, wrote to European data protection regulators on May 20 to push for investigations into these practices. “The DPC engaged with Apple on this issue when it first arose last summer and Apple has since made some changes,” Graham Doyle, Deputy Commissioner at the Irish DPC, said in an emailed statement to Reuters.  “However, we have followed up again with Apple following the release of this public statement and await responses,” he said, in reference to the letter. “In addition, it should be noted that the European Data Protection Board is working on the production of guidance in the area of voice assistant technologies.” Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. Apple said last year it would quit its default practice of retaining audio recordings of the requests users make to its Siri personal assistant and limit human review of what audio it does collect to its own employees rather than contractors. Le Bonniec’s letter, seen by Reuters, which was published on Thursday, said in reference to EU data protection laws: “Passing a law is not good enough: it needs to be enforced upon privacy offenders.” Le Bonniec worked as a subcontractor for Apple in its Irish offices, he said in the letter.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. dollar banknotes are seen in front of the Apple logo in this photo illustration taken August 3, 2018. Photo illustration taken August 3, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File PhotoApple’s offering illustrates how companies with the best credit ratings are boosting shareholder returns by tapping cheap debt made available through the Fed’s backstopping of the credit markets. Apple shares are virtually flat year-to-date, compared with a 12% drop in the S&P 500 Index.  The technology company raised $8.5 billion by selling four different bonds with maturities ranging from three years to 30 years. It sold a $2 billion three-year bond and a five-year $2.25 billion with coupons of 0.75% and 1.125% respectively, the lowest rates the company has paid on bonds with such durations since 2013, according to Refinitiv IFR data.  The coupons on Apple’s 10-year and 30-year bonds were also the lowest the company has paid in the past years, according to the Refinitiv data. The funds will go toward general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and dividend payments, Apple said in a regulatory filing. During the six months ended March 28, Apple spent $38.5 billion to repurchase its own stock.  The Fed slashed interest rates to almost zero in March and said it would act as buyer of last resort in the investment-grade corporate bond market, in a bid to help cash-strapped companies access capital markets roiled by the economic fallout from the pandemic.  While the Federal Reserve has yet to buy a single corporate bond, the intervention has fueled record issuance by companies in need of funding, such as Boeing Co, Marriott International Inc and Ford Motor Co. The policy has also allowed financially strong companies such as Apple, which had just over $40 billion in cash as of the end of March, to reduce its cost of capital to the benefit of shareholders. In the past week, drugmaker Biogen Inc and U.S. health insurer Anthem Inc have also sold new bonds at low rates, which the companies said were partly to fund share buybacks.  Goldman Sachs & Co, BofA Securities, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were joint book-running managers on the Apple bond offering.

The logo of U.S. technology company Apple is seen at a branch office in Basel, Switzerland March 2, 2020. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/FilesThe fine, the biggest ever levied by the French antitrust body, comes at a time of heightened scrutiny on U.S. tech giants by European regulators, who have been delving into the firms’ powerful market position, the tax they pay, and how they protect consumers’ privacy. Apple said it would appeal the watchdog’s ruling, which it said was at odds with legal precedent in France.  In its decision, the French regulator said Apple imposed prices on retail premium resellers so that the prices were aligned with those charged by the California firm in its own shops, or on the Internet.  The watchdog said Apple’s two wholesalers in France fully followed the U.S. company’s instructions on how to allocate its products to customers, instead of freely determining their commercial policy.  “Apple and its two wholesalers agreed not to compete with each other and to prevent distributors from competing with each other, thereby sterilising the wholesale market for Apple products,” the watchdog said in a statement.  The two wholesalers, Tech Data and Ingram Micro, were fined 76 million and 63 million euros respectively, the authority said. Tech Data had no immediate comment to make and Ingram Micro could not immediately be reached. “The French competition authority’s decision is disheartening,” Apple said in a statement announcing it planned to appeal.   “It relates to practices from over a decade ago and discards 30 years of legal precedent that all companies in France rely on with an order that will cause chaos for companies across all industries.” Since her nomination as the head of the French competition authority in 2016, Isabelle de Silva has set her sights on U.S. tech companies, including Alphabet Inc’s Google, which was fined 150 million euros ($167 million) for opaque advertising rules.

Tech Data had no immediate comment to make and Ingram Micro could not immediately be reached. “The French competition authority’s decision is disheartening,” Apple said in a statement announcing it planned to appeal.   “It relates to practices from over a decade ago and discards 30 years of legal precedent that all companies in France rely on with an order that will cause chaos for companies across all industries.” Since her nomination as the head of the French competition authority in 2016, Isabelle de Silva has set her sights on U.S. tech companies, including Alphabet Inc’s Google, which was fined 150 million euros ($167 million) for opaque advertising rules.

The logo of U.S. technology company Apple is seen at a branch office in Basel, Switzerland March 2, 2020. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/FilesThe fine, the biggest ever levied by the French antitrust body, comes at a time of heightened scrutiny on U.S. tech giants by European regulators, who have been delving into the firms’ powerful market position, the tax they pay, and how they protect consumers’ privacy. Apple said it would appeal the watchdog’s ruling, which it said was at odds with legal precedent in France.  In its decision, the French regulator said Apple imposed prices on retail premium resellers so that the prices were aligned with those charged by the California firm in its own shops, or on the Internet.

FILE PHOTO: People wearing protective masks wait for checking their temperature in an Apple Store, in Shanghai, China, as the country is hit by an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, February 21, 2020. REUTERS/Aly Song/File PhotoHigh-volume manufacturing is not scheduled until summer, but the first months of the year are when Apple irons out assembly processes with partners such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co’s (2317.TW) Foxconn, two former Apple employees said. “They probably have one assembly line they’re trying things out on,” said one of the former employees who asked not to be named discussing production matters. “Are Apple’s engineers with the Foxconn engineers? If they are, they’re probably making progress. But if they’re not, if they’re quarantined, that could be bad.” While Apple uses other contract manufacturers such as Wistron Corp (3231.TW) to make some iPhones, Taiwan’s Foxconn tends to handle the introduction of new models because its capabilities are the most advanced, supply chain experts said. Foxconn, the world’s largest contract electronics maker, delayed reopening key iPhone factories in Shenzhen and Zhengzhou after the Lunar New Year holiday but hopes to resume half of its Chinese production by the end of February. Senior Foxconn officials who have been working remotely from Taipei since the holiday have not yet returned to China on a large scale, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, speaking of company officials generally. Apple declined to comment. Foxconn Technology Group said in an emailed statement on Tuesday that the company is following all legally required health and safety practices at its factories to protect employee welfare.  “Consistent with this, we are taking a cautious approach in the implementation of our post-holiday production schedules in each of our facilities in China,” the company said. Last week, Apple warned investors it was unlikely to meet revenue targets for the first three months of 2020 and that global iPhone supplies would be limited as manufacturing sites in China were not ramping up production as quickly as expected. Foxconn said this month that the coronavirus outbreak would lower its revenue this year. Earlier this month, United Airlines (UAL.O), which has disclosed that Apple is a major customer, said it was cancelling all fights to China until late April. Apple, meanwhile, said on Jan. 28 that it was restricting employee to travel to China to “business-critical” situations. COLLABORATION CRITICAL For new iPhone models, the transition from prototype to the assembly of millions of units starts in earnest when the Lunar New Year holiday in China ends in late January and early February, people familiar with the process said. At that point, Apple has tested numerous prototypes and is in the late stages of what is called engineering validation, in which Foxconn workers assemble small numbers of devices while engineers from both firms troubleshoot. If delays occur at this stage it would eat into the time Apple needs to finalize orders for chips and other parts, almost all of which are custom-made for the iPhone. Because of the huge volumes needed, “they can’t wait to make component selections”, said Ron Keith, founder of Supply Chain Resources Group, which works with electronics makers such as Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Nest. In March and April, Apple engineers typically work with Foxconn counterparts to set up new assembly lines and do trial runs, before making final adjustments in April and May. The aim is to have production lines up and running in June so others can be added progressively to ramp up output. “It’s very complicated. There are so many variables in the environment, including small factors such as air pollution,” one of the people familiar with the process said.  Anna-Katrina Shedletsky, a former Apple engineer and founder of Instrumental, a startup focused on factory automation based in Mountain View, California, said on-the-ground engineering collaboration was critical for new products. “You can fly those engineers somewhere else but there’s knowledge about how you make a product in that environment. It’s not that it can’t be taught but it’s a hard thing to move,” she said.

Apple’s China website has listed the opening time for all stores, which vary from 10:00 am to 11:00 am local time. The website had previously carried an advisory saying not all stores were open. China placed curbs on travel and asked residents to avoid public places in late January, just ahead of the Lunar New Year festival, a major gift-giving holiday. Those restrictions stayed largely in place through most of February. The company sold fewer than half a million iPhones in China in February, government data showed on Monday, as the outbreak halved demand for smartphones. Apple had announced the shuttering of its branded stores in early February.

FILE PHOTO: People wearing protective masks wait for checking their temperature in an Apple Store, in Shanghai, China, as the country is hit by an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, February 21, 2020. REUTERS/Aly Song/File PhotoHigh-volume manufacturing is not scheduled until summer, but the first months of the year are when Apple irons out assembly processes with partners such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co’s (2317.TW) Foxconn, two former Apple employees said. “They probably have one assembly line they’re trying things out on,” said one of the former employees who asked not to be named discussing production matters. “Are Apple’s engineers with the Foxconn engineers? If they are, they’re probably making progress. But if they’re not, if they’re quarantined, that could be bad.” While Apple uses other contract manufacturers such as Wistron Corp (3231.TW) to make some iPhones, Taiwan’s Foxconn tends to handle the introduction of new models because its capabilities are the most advanced, supply chain experts said. Foxconn, the world’s largest contract electronics maker, delayed reopening key iPhone factories in Shenzhen and Zhengzhou after the Lunar New Year holiday but hopes to resume half of its Chinese production by the end of February. Senior Foxconn officials who have been working remotely from Taipei since the holiday have not yet returned to China on a large scale, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, speaking of company officials generally. Apple declined to comment. Foxconn Technology Group said in an emailed statement on Tuesday that the company is following all legally required health and safety practices at its factories to protect employee welfare.  “Consistent with this, we are taking a cautious approach in the implementation of our post-holiday production schedules in each of our facilities in China,” the company said. Last week, Apple warned investors it was unlikely to meet revenue targets for the first three months of 2020 and that global iPhone supplies would be limited as manufacturing sites in China were not ramping up production as quickly as expected. Foxconn said this month that the coronavirus outbreak would lower its revenue this year. Earlier this month, United Airlines (UAL.O), which has disclosed that Apple is a major customer, said it was cancelling all fights to China until late April. Apple, meanwhile, said on Jan. 28 that it was restricting employee to travel to China to “business-critical” situations. COLLABORATION CRITICAL For new iPhone models, the transition from prototype to the assembly of millions of units starts in earnest when the Lunar New Year holiday in China ends in late January and early February, people familiar with the process said. At that point, Apple has tested numerous prototypes and is in the late stages of what is called engineering validation, in which Foxconn workers assemble small numbers of devices while engineers from both firms troubleshoot. If delays occur at this stage it would eat into the time Apple needs to finalize orders for chips and other parts, almost all of which are custom-made for the iPhone. Because of the huge volumes needed, “they can’t wait to make component selections”, said Ron Keith, founder of Supply Chain Resources Group, which works with electronics makers such as Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Nest. In March and April, Apple engineers typically work with Foxconn counterparts to set up new assembly lines and do trial runs, before making final adjustments in April and May. The aim is to have production lines up and running in June so others can be added progressively to ramp up output. “It’s very complicated. There are so many variables in the environment, including small factors such as air pollution,” one of the people familiar with the process said.  Anna-Katrina Shedletsky, a former Apple engineer and founder of Instrumental, a startup focused on factory automation based in Mountain View, California, said on-the-ground engineering collaboration was critical for new products. “You can fly those engineers somewhere else but there’s knowledge about how you make a product in that environment. It’s not that it can’t be taught but it’s a hard thing to move,” she said.

The European Commission said its investigation would look into Apple’s requirement forcing app developers to sell to customers using its own in-app purchase system and rules preventing them from informing users of cheaper products elsewhere. The investigation will also cover all apps which compete with Apple in Europe, which could be icloud and gaming apps, following informal information received by regulators. The probe followed Swedish music streaming service Spotify’s complaint last year, which said Apple was unfairly restricting rivals to its own music steaming service Apple Music. Another gripe was the 30% fee levied on app developers. Spotify welcomed the EU move. A smaller rival filed a similar grievance related to e-books and audiobooks in March this year. “It appears that Apple obtained a ‘gatekeeper’ role when it comes to the distribution of apps and content to users of Apple’s popular devices,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. The second case focuses on Apple’s terms and conditions on how its mobile payment service Apple Pay should be used in merchants’ apps and websites, and also the company’s refusal to allow rivals access to the payment system. Regulators are also concerned that Apple Pay, launched in 2014 as the company diversified from sales of devices like iPhones and iPads, is the only mobile payment service allowed to use the “tap and go” functionality on iPhones.

An Apple Store employee shows the new Series 5 Apple Watch during the preview of the redesigned and reimagined Apple Fifth Avenue store in New York, U.S., September 19, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid - Last year, Apple's Heart Study here found that the watch could accurately detect atrial fibrillation, the most common type of irregular heartbeat, according to a study that explored the role of wearable devices in identifying potential heart problems. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke more than fivefold, according to the American Heart Association.  Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said the initial study proved the Apple Watch can detect atrial fibrillation with a low rate of false alarms, which helped Apple gain clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a watch app that takes an electrocardiogram, or EKG, measurement. The study with J&J aims to show if early detection leads to better health outcomes. “We want to follow the science all the way to the end, no matter what the outcomes are, and run this longitudinal study,” Williams told Reuters in an interview. “It’s not something that we have to do, but it’s the right thing to do.”  The joint effort, called “Heartline,” is significant because J&J is one of the world’s largest medical device makers and pharmaceutical companies.  “What we bring is clinical study capability on a very large scale,” said Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer, who said the study aims to track 150,000 participants with long-term follow-ups over two years. The study could also reach a different population than Apple’s original heart study, which included 400,000 participants but faced questions from medical experts because more than half of the people who signed up were under 40, a group already at low risk for atrial fibrillation. J&J targeted the study at population with a higher risk. Paul Burton, vice president of medical affairs at the J&J subsidiary running the study, said 70% of patients experiencing the condition are over 65. “What we’re trying to do here is definitively answer that question: If you take wearable technology and couple it with an app, can you reduce the risk of a stroke or death?” Burton said. The J&J study will be open to the more than 40 million people enrolled in traditional Medicare plans, which cover people aged 65 and older as well as the disabled. Study participants will be randomly assigned to either use only an iPhone app or use the app in conjunction with a watch capable of taking an EKG.  If patients who enroll are assigned to the arm of the study using the Apple Watch, they will be prompted to acquire one of the devices, which study officials said the participants can either purchase on their own for personal use for $49 or borrow free of charge for the study. The latest Apple Watch model starts at list price of $399. Burton said J&J and Apple were sharing the cost of subsidizing the watches. The study will pay participants, who must agree to share their Medicare claims data. Apple and J&J officials said that was key to proving whether the use of the app and watch lead to reduced stroke risk. “With tens of millions of watches on people’s wrists and us delivering this early detection, we have a huge responsibility to make sure that early detection is effective and really helping people with their health in the long haul,” Apple’s Williams told Reuters.

FILE PHOTO: Apple CEO Tim Cook talks with U.S. President Donald Trump as they participate in an American Workforce Policy Advisory Board meeting in the White House State Dining Room in Washington, U.S., March 6, 2019. REUTERS/Leah MillisThe trip, which has not yet been announced, would highlight Cook’s strong relationship with Trump as he seeks further relief for Apple from U.S. tariffs on imports from China. The tariffs are part of a prolonged, tit-for-tat trade war between the world’s largest economies.  Apple declined to comment. A White House spokesperson said the office has no scheduling announcements at this time.  In September, Apple said it would make its new Mac Pro desktop computers in Austin, Texas, where it had made previous models at a contract manufacturing facility. The announcement came days after U.S. trade regulators approved 10 out of 15 requests for tariff exemptions filed by Apple amid a broader reprieve on levies on computer parts. Earlier this month, Apple also asked the Trump administration to waive tariffs on Chinese-made Apple Watches, iPhone components and other consumer products, according to filings with trade regulators.  Trump has made boosting the U.S. manufacturing sector one of the goals of his presidency, taking to Twitter to pressure U.S. companies into keeping jobs at home, while he has punished China for what he says are unfair trade practices by levying hefty tariffs on billions in Chinese imports, which in turn have hurt U.S. companies. The visit would allow Trump to tout his strong bond with Cook, after many CEOs resigned from a business advisory board in 2017 following Trump’s tepid response to violence at a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia.   Tariff relief for Apple came after the Trump and Cook dined together in August, and Trump said Cook “made a good case” that tariffs could hurt the company against South Korean rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), whose products would not be subject to the same levies.    Trump hopes to reach a partial trade deal with China soon, but said Friday he has not yet decided what if any tariffs might be removed as part of such an agreement.   The visit will not be Trump’s first trip to the Lone Star state to tout U.S. manufacturing jobs. Last month, Trump toured a Louis Vuitton factory in Alvarado, accompanied by his daughter and presidential adviser Ivanka and top executives from parent group LVMH.   The appearance stirred discord, with Louis Vuitton designer Nicolas Ghesquiere decrying Trump’s visit to the factory, which is in addition to Vuitton’s two U.S. manufacturing hubs in California.

Earlier this month, Apple also asked the Trump administration to waive tariffs on Chinese-made Apple Watches, iPhone components and other consumer products, according to filings with trade regulators.  Trump has made boosting the U.S. manufacturing sector one of the goals of his presidency, taking to Twitter to pressure U.S. companies into keeping jobs at home, while he has punished China for what he says are unfair trade practices by levying hefty tariffs on billions in Chinese imports, which in turn have hurt U.S. companies. The visit would allow Trump to tout his strong bond with Cook, after many CEOs resigned from a business advisory board in 2017 following Trump’s tepid response to violence at a rally of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia.   Tariff relief for Apple came after the Trump and Cook dined together in August, and Trump said Cook “made a good case” that tariffs could hurt the company against South Korean rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), whose products would not be subject to the same levies.    Trump hopes to reach a partial trade deal with China soon, but said Friday he has not yet decided what if any tariffs might be removed as part of such an agreement.   The visit will not be Trump’s first trip to the Lone Star state to tout U.S. manufacturing jobs. Last month, Trump toured a Louis Vuitton factory in Alvarado, accompanied by his daughter and presidential adviser Ivanka and top executives from parent group LVMH.   The appearance stirred discord, with Louis Vuitton designer Nicolas Ghesquiere decrying Trump’s visit to the factory, which is in addition to Vuitton’s two U.S. manufacturing hubs in California.

An Apple Store employee shows the new Series 5 Apple Watch during the preview of the redesigned and reimagined Apple Fifth Avenue store in New York, U.S., September 19, 2019. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid - Last year, Apple's Heart Study here found that the watch could accurately detect atrial fibrillation, the most common type of irregular heartbeat, according to a study that explored the role of wearable devices in identifying potential heart problems. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke more than fivefold, according to the American Heart Association.  Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said the initial study proved the Apple Watch can detect atrial fibrillation with a low rate of false alarms, which helped Apple gain clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a watch app that takes an electrocardiogram, or EKG, measurement. The study with J&J aims to show if early detection leads to better health outcomes. “We want to follow the science all the way to the end, no matter what the outcomes are, and run this longitudinal study,” Williams told Reuters in an interview. “It’s not something that we have to do, but it’s the right thing to do.”  The joint effort, called “Heartline,” is significant because J&J is one of the world’s largest medical device makers and pharmaceutical companies.  “What we bring is clinical study capability on a very large scale,” said Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer, who said the study aims to track 150,000 participants with long-term follow-ups over two years. The study could also reach a different population than Apple’s original heart study, which included 400,000 participants but faced questions from medical experts because more than half of the people who signed up were under 40, a group already at low risk for atrial fibrillation. J&J targeted the study at population with a higher risk. Paul Burton, vice president of medical affairs at the J&J subsidiary running the study, said 70% of patients experiencing the condition are over 65. “What we’re trying to do here is definitively answer that question: If you take wearable technology and couple it with an app, can you reduce the risk of a stroke or death?” Burton said. The J&J study will be open to the more than 40 million people enrolled in traditional Medicare plans, which cover people aged 65 and older as well as the disabled. Study participants will be randomly assigned to either use only an iPhone app or use the app in conjunction with a watch capable of taking an EKG.  If patients who enroll are assigned to the arm of the study using the Apple Watch, they will be prompted to acquire one of the devices, which study officials said the participants can either purchase on their own for personal use for $49 or borrow free of charge for the study. The latest Apple Watch model starts at list price of $399. Burton said J&J and Apple were sharing the cost of subsidizing the watches. The study will pay participants, who must agree to share their Medicare claims data. Apple and J&J officials said that was key to proving whether the use of the app and watch lead to reduced stroke risk. “With tens of millions of watches on people’s wrists and us delivering this early detection, we have a huge responsibility to make sure that early detection is effective and really helping people with their health in the long haul,” Apple’s Williams told Reuters.

Last year, Apple's Heart Study here found that the watch could accurately detect atrial fibrillation, the most common type of irregular heartbeat, according to a study that explored the role of wearable devices in identifying potential heart problems. The new effort, called “Heartline,” is significant because J&J is one of the world’s largest medical device makers and pharmaceutical companies. “What we bring is clinical study capability on a very large scale,” said Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer, who said the study aims to track 150,000 participants with long-term follow-ups over two years. The study could also reach a different population than Apple’s original heart study, which included 400,000 participants but faced questions from medical experts because more than half of the people who signed up were under 40, a group already at low risk for atrial fibrillation. J&J targeted the study at population with a higher risk. Paul Burton, vice president of medical affairs at the J&J subsidiary running the study, said 70% of patients experiencing the condition are over 65. “What we’re trying to do here is definitively answer that question: If you take wearable technology and couple it with an app, can you reduce the risk of a stroke or death?” Burton said. The J&J study will be open to the more than 40 million people enrolled in traditional Medicare plans, which cover people aged 65 and older as well as the disabled. Study participants will be randomly assigned to either use only an iPhone app or use the app in conjunction with a watch capable of taking an electrocardiogram, or ECG. If patients who enroll are assigned to the arm of the study using the Apple Watch, they will be prompted to acquire one of the devices, which study officials said the participants can either purchase on their own for personal use for $49 or borrow free of charge for the study. The latest Apple Watch model starts at list price of $399. Burton said J&J and Apple were sharing the cost of subsidizing the watches. The study will also pay incentives to patients to participate. To take part, participants must share their Medicare claims data, which officials said was aimed at tracking the ultimate outcomes of using the app and watch.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration(Reuters) - The payments by Alphabet Inc’s Google to Apple Inc to be the default search engine on Apple’s Safari web browser create “a significant barrier to entry and expansion” for Google’s rivals in the search engine market, the UK markets regulator said in a report released on Wednesday.  Apple received the “substantial majority” of the 1.2 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) that Google paid to be the default search engine on a variety of devices in the United Kingdom in 2019, according to the report. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, in its final report investigating online platforms and digital advertising, said the arrangements between Apple and Google create “a significant barrier to entry and expansion” for Google’s rivals in the search engine market. Those rivals include Microsoft Corp’s Bing, Verizon Communications Inc-owned Yahoo and independent search engine DuckDuckGo, all of which also make payments to Apple in exchange for being search engine options on its devices, the report said. “Given the impact of preinstallations and defaults on mobile devices and Apple’s significant market share, it is our view that Apple’s existing arrangements with Google create a significant barrier to entry and expansion for rivals affecting competition between search engines on mobiles,” the regulators wrote in the report. Apple and Google did not immediately return requests for comment. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi earlier this year estimated that Apple generates about $9 billion per year globally from licensing arrangements, revenue with gross margins above 90% and with about 80% of the total coming from Google. Apple reports the revenue in its services segment, which investors are looking to for growth as consumers slow the pace of iPhone upgrades. In the report, the U.K. regulators said enforcement authorities should be given a range of options to address the Apple-Google arrangement, including requiring “choice screens” in which users decide which search engine to set as a default during device setup or restricting Apple’s ability to monetize default positions.  Apple told the regulators that monetization restrictions would be “very costly,” according to the report.

The shareholder proposal on freedom of expression focuses on Apple's 2017 removal of virtual private network apps here from its App Store in China. Such apps allow users to bypass China’s so-called “Great Firewall” aimed at restricting access to overseas sites. Apple opposes the proposal, saying it already provides extensive information about when it takes down apps at the request of governments around the world and that it follows the laws in countries where it operates. “ hile we may disagree with certain decisions at times, we do not believe it would be in the best interests of our users to simply abandon markets, which would leave consumers with fewer choices and fewer privacy protections,” Apple said in its opposition. Proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services both recommend votes in favor the measure, according to reports from them seen by Reuters. Apple shareholders have voted down human rights measures related to China in the past. They defeated a 2018 proposal here that urged Apple to create a human rights panel to oversee issues such as workplace conditions and censorship in China, with 94.4 percent of shareholders voting against it. Shareholders will also vote on a proposal to allow shareholders to nominate more than one director to Apple’s board and whether to tie executive compensation to environmental sustainability metrics. Apple opposes both proposals.

The movie’s debut on Apple’s newly launched streaming service Apple TV+ will also likely be delayed, the source said. No new dates for the release of the film were given. “The Banker” was supposed to go into a limited number of U.S. movie theaters on Dec. 6, and onto the streaming platform in January. However Apple canceled the planned Nov. 21 world premiere  saying it was investigating unspecified concerns. “Last week some concerns surrounding the film were brought to our attention,” Apple said in a statement on Wednesday, announcing the cancellation of the world premiere. “We, along with the filmmakers, need some time to look into these matters and determine the best next steps.” Apple has given no details of its concerns. “The Banker” is based on the real-life story of two African-American businessmen in the 1960s who sought to help people overcome racial barriers in banking. The movie stars Anthony Mackie and Samuel L. Jackson. Apple has been buying movies to feed Apple TV+, the subscription video streaming service that the iPhone maker launched this month.

REUTERS/Henry Nicholls(Reuters) - Newcomer Billie Eilish dominated Apple Music streams in 2019, scoring the top streamed album of the year with “When We Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?”, Apple Music said on Tuesday. Eilish, 17, who burst onto the alternative pop scene this year and is nominated for four Grammy Awards in January, came 5th on the list of most streamed songs, with “Bad Guy,” Apple Music said in a year-end list. Eilish’s “Bad Guy” single also came top of the most Shazamed songs of 2019, the music recognition app owned by Apple said. Apple has 60 million subscribers to its streaming music service, behind industry leader Spotify’s 113 million premium subscribers as of October. Another breakout artist, black, gay rapper Lil Nas X, had the top streamed song of 2019 on Apple Music with his viral hit “Old Town Road,” which also spent 19 weeks at the top of the Billboard charts. Colombian reggaeton artist J. Balvin, who was featured on hits “I Like It,” “Say My Name” and “China,” was the most Shazamed artist of 2019. Ariana Grande and Post Malone both had two entries on Apple Music’s global top 10 streamed songs of the year. Grande’s break-up ode “Thank U, Next” and single “7 Rings” were 3rd and 4th, while Post Malone’s “Sunflower,” from the “Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse” animated movie, and “Wow,” took 2nd and 6th place.

REUTERS/Mason Trinca/Files(Reuters) - Apple Inc plans to sell Mac computers with its own main processors by next year based on the chip designs currently used in its iPhones and iPads, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.  The iPhone maker is working on three Mac processors based on the A14 processor in its next iPhone, suggesting the company will transition more of its Mac lineup away from current supplier Intel Corp, the report here added citing people familiar with the matter. Apple started using Intel’s processors in 2006 and a year later all Mac computers featured its chips. Since then, Intel has made chips for other Apple products such as modem chips for its iPhones. Apple has always relied on outside suppliers for its modem chips, a crucial part that connects devices like the iPhone to wireless data networks. In a bid to make its own chips, Apple bought a majority of Intel’s modem business last July for $1 billion and settled a long legal battle with supplier Qualcomm Inc over the chipmaker’s patent licensing practices. Apple’s Mac computers generated $7.16 billion in revenue in the last reported quarter while Intel’s PC unit that includes modem chip sales recorded $10 billion in sales in the last quarter. Apple was planning to use its own chips in Mac computers beginning as early as 2020, Bloomberg had reported here in April 2018.

REUTERS/Mike Segar(Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Wednesday it is expanding a program to supply repair parts, tools and manuals for iPhones to independent repair shops in 32 countries in Europe as well as Canada. Apple began the program last year in the United States after years of lobbying against state-level “right to repair” bills that would have compelled it to provide parts to independent shops. Apple has long maintained a network of authorized service providers such as Best Buy Co Inc to perform warranty work, but smaller shops had complained that the program was too costly to join because of high volume commitments, leaving them without access to genuine Apple parts or the software tools needed to perform some repairs. Apple launched its program for those independent shops last August, making it free to join if technicians complete a training program. Apple said Wednesday that 140 businesses with 700 locations have signed up for the program in the United States. Some of the independent shops, such as uBreakiFix, have multiple locations, while some are sole proprietorships. “When a customer needs a repair, we want them to have a range of options that not only suits their needs but also guarantees safety and quality so their iPhone can be used for as long as possible,” Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said in a statement. Under the program, independent shops get access to Apple parts and tools to perform out-of-warranty repairs. They also get Apple parts at the same prices as authorized service centers and can still also use third-party after-market parts and set their own prices. The program only covers iPhones.  Independent shops must inform customers whether they are using genuine Apple parts and send any salvaged Apple parts back to the company, where they are either refurbished or recycled. Apple said it is also creating an online tool to verify whether an independent shop participates in its program.

FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Mike SegarThe iPhone maker said its global corporate operations such as offices and data centers are already carbon neutral but that it will extend its effort to the thousands of suppliers that contribute to its products.  Apple said it aims to achieve 75% of the goal by reducing emissions, with the remaining 25% coming from carbon removal or offset projects such as planting trees and restoring habitats.  For its supply chain, Apple aims to address what are termed “scope three” emissions, which come indirectly from a company’s value chain. In Apple’s case, this means contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd’s (2317.TW) Foxconn.  Apple said 74% of its overall carbon emissions are generated by product manufacturing. To address the scope three emissions from manufacturing, Apple said it will help set up a $100 million “U.S.-China Green Fund” to provide capital investments to suppliers for energy efficiency projects.  The company has also been working with suppliers to reduce emissions by using recycled materials, saying its iPhones now use recycled rare earth elements in a component called the taptic engine.  Rare earth elements are energy intensive to mine but are often used in amounts too small to make recycling economical. Apple said it has created a robot to recover the materials from some of its devices.  Apple said its carbon removal or offset efforts will come via a fund to assist projects such as restoring mangrove ecosystems in Colombia and savannas in Kenya. The company did not disclose a dollar figure for the fund.  Apple’s nature-based carbon removal strategy contrasts with other companies such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), which earlier this year said it would invest $1 billion over the next four years in engineering-based carbon removal technologies.  Apple’s most recent environmental report, covering fiscal 2018, put its carbon footprint at 25.2 million tons.

REUTERS/Mike SegarThe iPhone maker said its global corporate operations such as offices and data centers are already carbon neutral but that it will extend its effort to the thousands of suppliers that contribute to its products.  Apple said it aims to achieve 75% of the goal by reducing emissions, with the remaining 25% coming from carbon removal or offset projects such as planting trees and restoring habitats.  For its supply chain, Apple aims to address what are termed “scope three” emissions, which come indirectly from a company’s value chain. In Apple’s case, this means contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd’s (2317.TW) Foxconn.  Apple said 74% of its overall carbon emissions are generated by product manufacturing. To address the scope three emissions from manufacturing, Apple said it will help set up a $100 million “U.S.-China Green Fund” to provide capital investments to suppliers for energy efficiency projects.  The company has also been working with suppliers to reduce emissions by using recycled materials, saying its iPhones now use recycled rare earth elements in a component called the taptic engine.  Rare earth elements are energy intensive to mine but are often used in amounts too small to make recycling economical. Apple said it has created a robot to recover the materials from some of its devices.  Apple said its carbon removal or offset efforts will come via a fund to assist projects such as restoring mangrove ecosystems in Colombia and savannas in Kenya. The company did not disclose a dollar figure for the fund.  Apple’s nature-based carbon removal strategy contrasts with other companies such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), which earlier this year said it would invest $1 billion over the next four years in engineering-based carbon removal technologies.  Apple’s most recent environmental report, covering fiscal 2018, put its carbon footprint at 25.2 million tons.

REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/Files(Reuters) - As Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc worked toward a high-profile distribution deal at least a couple of years ago, one proposal on the table was for Apple to have “competing ads removed from search” results on Amazon, according to documents released on Wednesday from a U.S. House of Representatives investigation. The document, which is not dated but shows Apple products released in late 2017, offers rare insight into how two of the world’s most valuable companies considered using their size for special treatment from one another. For years, Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, carried only a limited set of Apple products. Users often found used Apple products, and in some cases, knockoffs. That changed in 2018 when the two announced a deal for Apple and some approved resellers to market iPhones to Amazon customers in several countries in exchange for a promise from Amazon to rid its site of Apple products from third-party merchants not authorized by Apple. Investigators for the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel asked for documents related to the deal, turning up a slide presentation marked “Apple Confidential” that appeared to discuss principles and proposed terms.  Among them was that Amazon would have a “Differentiated Apple Customer Experience” that would include “competing ads removed from search,” product detail pages and checkout pages, according to the document. It proposed that ad treatment would be the same “as for Amazon products.” Another was that Amazon’s “Buy Box” would be turned off “for limited Apple-agreed situations.” The Buy Box is Amazon’s automated recommendation for which merchant out of several selling the same item should get the sale and whose non-public algorithms bear heavily on the success of independent sellers. It was unclear if the proposals were ultimately discussed or part of the final agreement. Amazon and Apple did not immediately comment.

REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Wednesday expanded its news offerings with audio versions of stories narrated by voice actors for subscribers, a morning newscast hosted by two journalists and more access to local newspaper stories. Apple says it has 125 million monthly active users of its Apple News product, but it does not disclose revenues or the number of subscribers to the paid version, Apple News+, which costs $9.99 a month for U.S. users. The iPhone maker maintains a staff of editors that curate the stories in both the paid and free versions of its app. Apple said Wednesday that paying subscribers will gain access to audio versions of longer stories from magazines such as such as Esquire and Vanity Fair, along with newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times.  The audio effort intensifies competition with Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google, both of whom offer audio news options on their smart home speakers, as well as Spotify Technology SA, which has been expanding its podcast business with news content. Apple is also launching a weekday morning audio news program called Apple News Today, which will be hosted by New York-based journalists Shumita Basu and Duarte Geraldino and highlight stories from the publishers that work with Apple. The show will be available to both free and paying users, and both it and the audio stories will also be adapted for Apple’s CarPlay, the system that connects iPhones to many newer vehicles. Apple also said it would offer expanded access to local news in its app, starting with five metro areas in the United States: San Francisco and the rest of the Bay Area, Houston, Los Angeles and New York. Apple will maintain editors in each area to curate local stories, and paying News+ subscribers will get access to premium content from the local newspapers that take part in the program.

REUTERS/Mike Segar(Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Wednesday it is expanding a program to supply repair parts, tools and manuals for iPhones to independent repair shops in 32 countries in Europe as well as Canada. Apple began the program last year in the United States after years of lobbying against state-level “right to repair” bills that would have compelled it to provide parts to independent shops. Apple has long maintained a network of authorized service providers such as Best Buy Co Inc to perform warranty work, but smaller shops had complained that the program was too costly to join because of high volume commitments, leaving them without access to genuine Apple parts or the software tools needed to perform some repairs. Apple launched its program for those independent shops last August, making it free to join if technicians complete a training program. Apple said Wednesday that 140 businesses with 700 locations have signed up for the program in the United States. Some of the independent shops, such as uBreakiFix, have multiple locations, while some are sole proprietorships. “When a customer needs a repair, we want them to have a range of options that not only suits their needs but also guarantees safety and quality so their iPhone can be used for as long as possible,” Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said in a statement. Under the program, independent shops get access to Apple parts and tools to perform out-of-warranty repairs. They also get Apple parts at the same prices as authorized service centers and can still also use third-party after-market parts and set their own prices. The program only covers iPhones.  Independent shops must inform customers whether they are using genuine Apple parts and send any salvaged Apple parts back to the company, where they are either refurbished or recycled. Apple said it is also creating an online tool to verify whether an independent shop participates in its program.

Apple said it aims to achieve 75% of the goal by reducing emissions, with the remaining 25% coming from carbon removal or offset projects such as planting trees and restoring habitats.  For its supply chain, Apple aims to address what are termed “scope three” emissions, which come indirectly from a company’s value chain. In Apple’s case, this means contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd’s (2317.TW) Foxconn.  Apple said 74% of its overall carbon emissions are generated by product manufacturing. To address the scope three emissions from manufacturing, Apple said it will help set up a $100 million “U.S.-China Green Fund” to provide capital investments to suppliers for energy efficiency projects.  The company has also been working with suppliers to reduce emissions by using recycled materials, saying its iPhones now use recycled rare earth elements in a component called the taptic engine.  Rare earth elements are energy intensive to mine but are often used in amounts too small to make recycling economical. Apple said it has created a robot to recover the materials from some of its devices.  Apple said its carbon removal or offset efforts will come via a fund to assist projects such as restoring mangrove ecosystems in Colombia and savannas in Kenya. The company did not disclose a dollar figure for the fund.  Apple’s nature-based carbon removal strategy contrasts with other companies such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), which earlier this year said it would invest $1 billion over the next four years in engineering-based carbon removal technologies.  Apple’s most recent environmental report, covering fiscal 2018, put its carbon footprint at 25.2 million tons.

REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes/Files(Reuters) - As Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc worked toward a high-profile distribution deal at least a couple of years ago, one proposal on the table was for Apple to have “competing ads removed from search” results on Amazon, according to documents released on Wednesday from a U.S. House of Representatives investigation. The document, which is not dated but shows Apple products released in late 2017, offers rare insight into how two of the world’s most valuable companies considered using their size for special treatment from one another. For years, Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, carried only a limited set of Apple products. Users often found used Apple products, and in some cases, knockoffs. That changed in 2018 when the two announced a deal for Apple and some approved resellers to market iPhones to Amazon customers in several countries in exchange for a promise from Amazon to rid its site of Apple products from third-party merchants not authorized by Apple. Investigators for the House Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel asked for documents related to the deal, turning up a slide presentation marked “Apple Confidential” that appeared to discuss principles and proposed terms.  Among them was that Amazon would have a “Differentiated Apple Customer Experience” that would include “competing ads removed from search,” product detail pages and checkout pages, according to the document. It proposed that ad treatment would be the same “as for Amazon products.” Another was that Amazon’s “Buy Box” would be turned off “for limited Apple-agreed situations.” The Buy Box is Amazon’s automated recommendation for which merchant out of several selling the same item should get the sale and whose non-public algorithms bear heavily on the success of independent sellers. It was unclear if the proposals were ultimately discussed or part of the final agreement. Amazon and Apple did not immediately comment.

The movie’s debut on Apple’s newly launched streaming service Apple TV+ will also likely be delayed, the source said. No new dates for the release of the film were given. “The Banker” was supposed to go into a limited number of U.S. movie theaters on Dec. 6, and onto the streaming platform in January. However Apple canceled the planned Nov. 21 world premiere  saying it was investigating unspecified concerns. “Last week some concerns surrounding the film were brought to our attention,” Apple said in a statement on Wednesday, announcing the cancellation of the world premiere. “We, along with the filmmakers, need some time to look into these matters and determine the best next steps.” Apple has given no details of its concerns. “The Banker” is based on the real-life story of two African-American businessmen in the 1960s who sought to help people overcome racial barriers in banking. The movie stars Anthony Mackie and Samuel L. Jackson. Apple has been buying movies to feed Apple TV+, the subscription video streaming service that the iPhone maker launched this month.

FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File PhotoThe proposal, which called for Apple to report whether it has “publicly committed to respect freedom of expression as a human right,” was defeated, but 40.6% of votes cast supported the measure, according to company figures. The proposal highlighted Apple’s 2017 removal of virtual private network apps from its App Store in China. Such apps allow users to bypass China’s so-called Great Firewall aimed at restricting access to overseas sites, and Apple’s action was seen as a step to preserve access to the country’s vast market. Wednesday’s vote stood in contrast to previous years when critics made little headway with big investors on the issue. “A total this high is a striking warning — and it must have come from big institutional investors, not just retail shareholders — that Apple’s human rights policy in China has become a material risk for the company’s reputation,” said Stephen Davis, a senior fellow at Harvard Law School’s Program on Corporate Governance. “Apple will be under great pressure to respond rather than ignore this vote,” Davis said. An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the results. Apple had opposed the proposal, saying it already provides extensive information about when it takes down apps at the request of governments around the world and that it follows the laws in countries where it operates.  SumOfUs, the group that put the measure on the ballot, celebrated the totals.  “Apple’s investors have sounded the alarm that Tim Cook needs to listen to the concerns raised by frontline communities such as Tibetans and Uighurs who have long suffered under a tech dystopia,” said Sondhya Gupta, a campaign manager for the group. Cook is Apple’s chief executive. In the past, Apple shareholders have voted down human rights measures related to China by much larger margins. A 2018 proposal that urged Apple to create a human rights panel to oversee issues such as workplace conditions and censorship in China was defeated, with 94.4% of votes cast against it. Sentiment appears to have shifted, experts said. “Given the high level of support received for the proposal, we expect to see the company engage with its shareholders on the issue and report to shareholders about what happened in the engagements, including any potential actions it intends to take as a result,” said Kern McPherson, vice president of research and engagement for proxy advisory firm Glass, Lewis & Co, which supported the measure. Apple has signaled it is considering action. In a letter earlier this month to Access Now, an open-internet advocacy group, Apple’s senior privacy director, Jane Horvath, wrote: “Apple has and always will consider freedom of expression a fundamental human right.” The company, she said, “will consider providing additional details on our commitment in the future.” The proposal was one of six topics to be voted on at Wednesday’s shareholder meeting. By wide margins, shareholders approved Apple’s executive pay, existing board of directors and the retention of Ernst & Young as its accounting firm, results that were widely expected. A “proxy access” proposal to allow shareholders to nominate more than one director to Apple’s board was defeated, with 68.9% of votes cast against. Also voted down was a measure to tie executive compensation to environmental sustainability metrics, with 87.9% of votes cast against it, according to the company.     Shareholders defeated a “proxy access” proposal to allow shareholders to nominate more than one director to Apple’s board, with 68.9% of votes cast against.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration(Reuters) - The payments by Alphabet Inc’s Google to Apple Inc to be the default search engine on Apple’s Safari web browser create “a significant barrier to entry and expansion” for Google’s rivals in the search engine market, the UK markets regulator said in a report released on Wednesday.  Apple received the “substantial majority” of the 1.2 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) that Google paid to be the default search engine on a variety of devices in the United Kingdom in 2019, according to the report. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, in its final report investigating online platforms and digital advertising, said the arrangements between Apple and Google create “a significant barrier to entry and expansion” for Google’s rivals in the search engine market. Those rivals include Microsoft Corp’s Bing, Verizon Communications Inc-owned Yahoo and independent search engine DuckDuckGo, all of which also make payments to Apple in exchange for being search engine options on its devices, the report said. “Given the impact of preinstallations and defaults on mobile devices and Apple’s significant market share, it is our view that Apple’s existing arrangements with Google create a significant barrier to entry and expansion for rivals affecting competition between search engines on mobiles,” the regulators wrote in the report. Apple and Google did not immediately return requests for comment. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi earlier this year estimated that Apple generates about $9 billion per year globally from licensing arrangements, revenue with gross margins above 90% and with about 80% of the total coming from Google. Apple reports the revenue in its services segment, which investors are looking to for growth as consumers slow the pace of iPhone upgrades. In the report, the U.K. regulators said enforcement authorities should be given a range of options to address the Apple-Google arrangement, including requiring “choice screens” in which users decide which search engine to set as a default during device setup or restricting Apple’s ability to monetize default positions.  Apple told the regulators that monetization restrictions would be “very costly,” according to the report.

FILE PHOTO: The Apple Inc. logo is seen hanging at the entrance to the Apple store on 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York, U.S., October 16, 2019. REUTERS/Mike SegarThe iPhone maker said its global corporate operations such as offices and data centers are already carbon neutral but that it will extend its effort to the thousands of suppliers that contribute to its products.  Apple said it aims to achieve 75% of the goal by reducing emissions, with the remaining 25% coming from carbon removal or offset projects such as planting trees and restoring habitats.  For its supply chain, Apple aims to address what are termed “scope three” emissions, which come indirectly from a company’s value chain. In Apple’s case, this means contract manufacturers such as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd’s (2317.TW) Foxconn.  Apple said 74% of its overall carbon emissions are generated by product manufacturing. To address the scope three emissions from manufacturing, Apple said it will help set up a $100 million “U.S.-China Green Fund” to provide capital investments to suppliers for energy efficiency projects.  The company has also been working with suppliers to reduce emissions by using recycled materials, saying its iPhones now use recycled rare earth elements in a component called the taptic engine.  Rare earth elements are energy intensive to mine but are often used in amounts too small to make recycling economical. Apple said it has created a robot to recover the materials from some of its devices.  Apple said its carbon removal or offset efforts will come via a fund to assist projects such as restoring mangrove ecosystems in Colombia and savannas in Kenya. The company did not disclose a dollar figure for the fund.  Apple’s nature-based carbon removal strategy contrasts with other companies such as Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), which earlier this year said it would invest $1 billion over the next four years in engineering-based carbon removal technologies.  Apple’s most recent environmental report, covering fiscal 2018, put its carbon footprint at 25.2 million tons.

0,AAPL,"January 28, 2020","                Apple's iPhone back to growth as company braces for coronavirus impact - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsIndiaSouth AsiaTVMoreIndia Technology NewsJanuary 28, 2020 /  9:37 PM / 6 months agoApple's iPhone back to growth as company braces for coronavirus impactStephen Nellis6 Min Read(Reuters) - The iPhone is back. But Apple is girding for more disruptions in virus-hit China. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Tuesday reported sales and profits for the holiday shopping quarter above Wall Street expectations, thanks to rising iPhone sales for the first time in a year and soaring demand for add-ons like AirPods wireless headphones. The performance outweighed concerns about the coronavirus outbreak in China, a major market and manufacturing hub for Apple, and a slight revenue miss in the company’s services business, which includes the new Apple TV+ streaming offering. Shares of Apple rose 2% in after-hours trade. Apple forecasted revenue for the quarter ending in March above Wall Street expectations. Chief Executive Tim Cook told Reuters the company used a wider-than-normal prediction range because of the uncertainty created by the coronavirus.       “We have limited travel to business-critical situations as of last week,” he said. “The situation is emerging, and we’re still gathering lots of data points and monitoring it very closely.” Apple has suppliers in the Wuhan area, the heart of the outbreak, but has alternatives, Cook said. Factories outside Wuhan area will not reopen after the Lunar New Year holiday until Feb. 10, Cook said, but Apple built the delayed restart into its wider revenue forecast. Apple has shut one store in China, he said, and reduced hours at others because of lower foot traffic, Cook said. Third-party stores that sell Apple products are also facing some closures, Cook said. Apple is “forecasting a stronger Q2 than analysts predicted, but the fact that the coronavirus is spreading in unpredictable ways in China, where Apple has most of its hardware built, could upset this optimistic forecast,” said eMarketer principal analyst Yoram Wurmser. FILE PHOTO: A 3D printed Apple logo is seen in front of a displayed stock graph in this illustration taken February 26, 2016. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File PhotoSERVICES MISS BUT GROWING The number of active iPhones, computers and other devices owned by customers, called Apple’s installed base, grew by 100 million to more than 1.5 billion over the past year. Apple executives set a new target of 600 million paid subscribers for music, TV, gaming and other services by the end of calendar 2020.      Apple’s share price has more than doubled since Cook warned a year ago that the company was likely to miss financial targets for its biggest sales quarter of its fiscal 2019. In the year since, Apple slashed prices in China, one of its most important markets, to rekindle sales there. Apple posted $91.8 billion (69.8 billion pounds) in revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 28, compared with analyst estimates of $88.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Apple reported earnings per share of $4.99, compared with analyst estimates of $4.55 per share.     The company forecast $63.0 billion to $67.0 billion in revenue for the quarter ending in March, ahead of estimates of $62.4 billion, showing it believes that its phones and other devices such as AirPods wireless headphones will continue to sell well during what is often a slow time of year.  Apple has made a push into paid services, rolling out a credit card with Goldman Sachs and subscription gaming and television services last year. Services revenue was $12.7 billion, below analyst estimates of $13 billion, and up from $10.9 billion the year before. “Services are important, but the trajectory is heading on target. I feel they’ve made good progress on that front,” said Hal Eddins, chief economist for Apple shareholder Capital Investment Counsel.  The shift towards services, however, depends on Apple continuing to grow its base of users and sign them up for recurring subscriptions that analysts view as potentially more lucrative than hardware sales. Apple said it now has more than 1.5 billion active installed devices and 480 million subscribers to both its own and third-party paid services, compared with 1.4 billion devices and 360 million subscribers a year earlier. Cook said the company’s Apple TV+ subscription streaming video service released last fall was a “rousing success” and that it is “very strong, both the people that are getting it in the bundle and the people that are paying for it that haven’t bought a new device.”    IPhone sales of $55.96 billion beat analyst estimates of $51.6 billion and year-before sales of $52 billion, snapping a yearlong trend of major sales declines for Apple’s biggest-selling hardware product. Cook said that the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models drove the growth and also factored into the company’s forecast, calling the devices “the strongest iPhone lineup we’ve ever had.” But Apple’s wearables segment – which, along with AirPods, also includes the Apple Watch – hit $10.0 billion in revenue versus estimates of $9.5 billion, up sharply from $7.3 billion the year before.  Cook told Reuters that Apple could not make enough AirPods and Apple Watch Series 3 devices to meet demand during the fiscal first quarter and continues to be short on both. Cook said Apple does not have an estimate for when it will be able to fulfil demand for AirPods. Slideshow (2 Images)“We’re working on both of those very hard,” Cook told Reuters.

The app, which will be available in the app store as “COVID-19,” will ask users questions about symptoms, location and risk factors and then provide the appropriate up-to-date guidance from the CDC, White House officials said.

REUTERS/Mike Segar(Reuters) - Apple Inc said on Wednesday it is expanding a program to supply repair parts, tools and manuals for iPhones to independent repair shops in 32 countries in Europe as well as Canada. Apple began the program last year in the United States after years of lobbying against state-level “right to repair” bills that would have compelled it to provide parts to independent shops. Apple has long maintained a network of authorized service providers such as Best Buy Co Inc to perform warranty work, but smaller shops had complained that the program was too costly to join because of high volume commitments, leaving them without access to genuine Apple parts or the software tools needed to perform some repairs. Apple launched its program for those independent shops last August, making it free to join if technicians complete a training program. Apple said Wednesday that 140 businesses with 700 locations have signed up for the program in the United States. Some of the independent shops, such as uBreakiFix, have multiple locations, while some are sole proprietorships. “When a customer needs a repair, we want them to have a range of options that not only suits their needs but also guarantees safety and quality so their iPhone can be used for as long as possible,” Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said in a statement. Under the program, independent shops get access to Apple parts and tools to perform out-of-warranty repairs. They also get Apple parts at the same prices as authorized service centers and can still also use third-party after-market parts and set their own prices. The program only covers iPhones.  Independent shops must inform customers whether they are using genuine Apple parts and send any salvaged Apple parts back to the company, where they are either refurbished or recycled. Apple said it is also creating an online tool to verify whether an independent shop participates in its program.

Shares of Tesla surged 16% early in the session before joining a sell-off along with other big-name Nasdaq stocks, including Amazon , Microsoft  and Nvidia , that have outperformed in recent months. With investors betting Tesla could show a quarterly profit in its July 22 report and potentially join the S&P 500 index, traders at one point on Monday paid $1,794.99 per share, a premium of almost $300 over Tesla’s previous closing price. Only the second daily decline for Tesla in 10 sessions came after the company on Saturday cut the price of its Model Y sport utility vehicle by $3,000, just four months after its launch, as it tries to maintain sales momentum in the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, announced earlier this month, have some analysts and investors expecting the company will show a profit in its quarterly report. That would mark Tesla’s first cumulative four-quarter profit, a key requirement for it to be added to the S&P 500.

FILE PHOTO: SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk arrives on the red carpet for the automobile awards ""Das Goldene Lenkrad"" (The golden steering wheel) given by a German newspaper in Berlin, Germany, November 12, 2019. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File PhotoFueled by stronger-than-expected car deliveries, shares of Tesla have surged over 40% in the past seven sessions, elevating the company’s market capitalization to $259 billion. More important for Musk’s personal finances, Tesla’s six-month average market capitalization has reached a record $138 billion. Hitting a six-month average market capitalization of $150 billion would trigger the vesting of the second of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire to buy Tesla stock as part of his 2018 pay package. In early May, Musk’s first tranche vested after Tesla’s six-month average stock market value reached $100 billion.  (Graphic: Elon Musk's big payday, here)   Musk has already achieved targets related to Tesla’s financial growth that are also required in order to vest the approaching options tranche.  Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each. At Tesla’s current stock price of $1,397, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares related to the tranche that vested in May and the upcoming tranche for a combined profit of over $3.5 billion, or $1.8 billion per tranche. Musk’s first tranche was worth about $700 million in May, when it vested, but its value has since increased along with Tesla’s stock price. Tesla has surged 500% over the past year as the company increased sales of its Model 3 sedan. Tesla last week reported higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, defying plummeting sales in the wider auto industry as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the global economy. The solid delivery numbers heightened expectations of a profitable second quarter, which would mark four consecutive profitable quarters, a first for Tesla, and a key hurdle to be added to the S&P 500 index. Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, receives no salary, only the options in his pay package. A full payoff of all tranches would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives. When Tesla unveiled Musk’s pay package, it said he could theoretically reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued. However, Tesla has since issued shares to compensate employees, and also sold shares in secondary offers, including a $2 billion stock sale in February.

More important for Musk’s personal finances, Tesla’s six-month average market capitalization has reached a record $138 billion. Hitting a six-month average market capitalization of $150 billion would trigger the vesting of the second of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire to buy Tesla stock as part of his 2018 pay package.

(Graphic: Elon Musk's big payday, here)   Musk has already achieved targets related to Tesla’s financial growth that are also required in order to vest the approaching options tranche.

At Tesla’s current stock price of $1,397, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares related to the tranche that vested in May and the upcoming tranche for a combined profit of over $3.5 billion, or $1.8 billion per tranche. Musk’s first tranche was worth about $700 million in May, when it vested, but its value has since increased along with Tesla’s stock price. Tesla has surged 500% over the past year as the company increased sales of its Model 3 sedan. Tesla last week reported higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, defying plummeting sales in the wider auto industry as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the global economy. The solid delivery numbers heightened expectations of a profitable second quarter, which would mark four consecutive profitable quarters, a first for Tesla, and a key hurdle to be added to the S&P 500 index. Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, receives no salary, only the options in his pay package. A full payoff of all tranches would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives. When Tesla unveiled Musk’s pay package, it said he could theoretically reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued.

Only the second daily decline for Tesla in 10 sessions came after the company on Saturday cut the price of its Model Y sport utility vehicle by $3,000, just four months after its launch, as it tries to maintain sales momentum in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Tesla’s stock was down 3% in afternoon trading, eroding a recent rally that has elevated the company’s market capitalization to almost $300 billion, larger than any other carmaker. Despite Tuesday’s stock dip, and importantly for Musk’s personal finances, Tesla’s six-month average market capitalization for the first time has reached $150 billion. That triggers the vesting of the second of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire in his 2018 pay package to buy Tesla stock at a discount. Musk, who is also majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, receives no salary. Even with Tuesday’s decline in Tesla’s stock, its six-month average market capitalization rose, thanks to the stock’s strong rally in recent months. In early May, Musk’s first tranche vested after Tesla’s six-month average stock market value reached $100 billion. Musk has already achieved targets related to Tesla’s financial growth that are also required in order to vest the latest options tranche. Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each, less than a quarter of their current price. At Tesla’s current stock price of $1,594, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares related to the tranche that vested in May and the current tranche for a combined profit of $4.2 billion, or almost $2.1 billion per tranche. Musk’s first tranche was worth about $700 million in May, when it vested, but its value has since increased along with Tesla’s stock price. The median compensation for Tesla employees last year was about $58,000, according to a company filing. Tesla’s stock has surged more than 500% over the past year as the company increased sales of its Model 3 sedan. Following higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, some investors believe Tesla might report a profit in its second-quarter report on Wednesday after the bell. That would mark four consecutive profitable quarters, a first for Tesla and a key hurdle for it to be added to the S&P 500 index . Analysts on average expect a $240 million loss for the quarter, according to Refinitiv. A month ago, analysts expected a loss of almost $340 million.

It was not clear where in Singapore the new hires would be based, or whether the U.S. automaker currently has any employees in the country.

It aims to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040, and make a bigger bet on electrification to cut greenhouse gases and slow climate change. Two years ago, Musk responded to a Tesla admirer in Singapore who asked the executive to make the automaker’s vehicles available in the city-state. “We tried, but Singapore govt is not supportive of electric vehicles,” Musk tweeted. Unlike traditional automakers, Tesla prefers to sell its cars directly through its own showrooms. Local dealership Hong Seh Motors on its website said it is Singapore’s only retailer of Tesla cars.

Musk has often taken umbrage at short-sellers and in 2018 sent a box of shorts to hedge fund owner and Tesla short-seller David Einhorn. The “Short Shorts” on the Tesla shop website feature gold trim and “S3XY” in gold across the back, which also happens to be formed from Tesla model names. The shorts cost $69.420, the last three digits an apparent reference to Musk’s infamous tweet in 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share, with 420 also a code word for marijuana. That tweet landed him in hot water with the U.S. securities regulator, costing him his position as Tesla chairman. The Silicon Valley car maker, however, has reason to crow. Its stock has almost tripled in value this year to just over $1,200 per share and it sold more than 90,000 of its electric vehicles in the second quarter, defying a trend of plummeting sales for other automakers hit by coronavirus-induced lockdowns.  “Run like the wind or entertain like Liberace,” the product description says, adding: “Enjoy exceptional comfort from the closing bell.” It will ship within 2-4 weeks. Tesla is expected to announce earnings results for April-June quarter this month, with analysts saying the second-quarter deliveries had heightened expectations that it will report four consecutive quarters of profit for the first time in its history.

Musk has often taken umbrage at short-sellers and in 2018 sent a box of shorts to hedge fund owner and Tesla short-seller David Einhorn. The “Short Shorts” on the Tesla shop website feature gold trim and “S3XY” in gold across the back, which also happens to be formed from Tesla model names. The shorts cost $69.420, the last three digits an apparent reference to Musk’s infamous tweet in 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share, with 420 also a code word for marijuana. That tweet landed him in hot water with the U.S. securities regulator, costing him his position as Tesla chairman. The Silicon Valley car maker, however, has reason to crow. Its stock has almost tripled in value this year to just over $1,200 per share and it sold more than 90,000 of its electric vehicles in the second quarter, defying a trend of plummeting sales for other automakers hit by coronavirus-induced lockdowns.  “Run like the wind or entertain like Liberace,” the product description says, adding: “Enjoy exceptional comfort from the closing bell.” It will ship within 2-4 weeks. Tesla is expected to announce earnings results for April-June quarter this month, with analysts saying the second-quarter deliveries had heightened expectations that it will report four consecutive quarters of profit for the first time in its history.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoThe decision marks a step forward for Texas as it vies with Oklahoma to attract a new factory to build Tesla’s Y sport utility vehicles and cybertrucks.  A majority of commissioners in Travis County voted in favor of providing the electric carmaker with a tax rebate worth at least $14.7 million.  That brings the total amount of tax rebates to nearly $65 million after the Del Valle school district, which includes the proposed factory site, approved a $50 million incentive on Thursday. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The electric carmaker only has a single vehicle manufacturing plant in California and has said it wants to start building a large second plant in the southwestern United States as early as the third quarter of this year.. Commissioners in favor of the agreement decided to move forward after a Tesla representative said executives had met with the governor of a rival state, without naming the state. The city of Tulsa in Oklahoma has campaigned for Tesla to build the plant there. Tesla has asked Travis County for an 80% rebate on its property taxes for 10 years, worth $14.7 million, as well as a 65% rebate for the next 10 years after that. Tesla said the factory would create 5,000 jobs, mostly low-skilled. The average annual salary would be roughly $47,000, an income considered low by the county’s health and human services division.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/FilesSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has advertised for servicing staff in Singapore, a country previously criticised by Chief Executive Elon Musk as unsupportive of electric vehicles. Listings for five jobs in Singapore on networking website LinkedIn are mainly in servicing and repair, such as a service technician and parts adviser. It was not clear where in Singapore the new hires would be based, or whether the U.S. automaker currently has any employees in the country. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on its Singapore plans. Singapore is one of the world’s most expensive places to buy a car and has few electric vehicles. It aims to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040, and make a bigger bet on electrification to cut greenhouse gases and slow climate change. Two years ago, Musk responded to a Tesla admirer in Singapore who asked the executive to make the automaker’s vehicles available in the city-state. “We tried, but Singapore govt is not supportive of electric vehicles,” Musk tweeted. Unlike traditional automakers, Tesla prefers to sell its cars directly through its own showrooms. Local dealership Hong Seh Motors on its website said it is Singapore’s only retailer of Tesla cars. It did not respond to an emailed request for comment.

REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo(Reuters) - Electric carmaker Tesla Inc has entered into an agreement for a working capital loan of up to 4 billion yuan ($565.51 million) with a lender from China for its Shanghai car plant, according to a regulatory filing on Friday. The loan, which will be provided by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited, will be used only for expenditures related to production at the Shanghai plant, the filing said. The factory is Tesla’s first car manufacturing site outside the United States and is the centerpiece of its ambitions to boost sales in the world’s biggest auto market and to avoid higher import tariffs imposed on U.S.-made cars. Tesla had suspended production at its San Francisco Bay Area plant due to the broader impact of the coronavirus, and was told by the local county health department on Friday that it “must not reopen” as local lockdown measures remain in effect.

FILE PHOTO: A Tesla sign is seen on the Shanghai Gigafactory of the U.S. electric car maker before a delivery ceremony in Shanghai, China January 7, 2020. REUTERS/Aly Song With Tesla still up more than 25% since the company posted its second consecutive quarterly profit a week ago, Canaccord Genuity cut its rating on Tesla to “hold” from “buy,” further shrinking the already small number of analysts who recommend buying the stock.  Tesla Vice President Tao Lin said on the Weibo social media platform that car deliveries from its new Shanghai plant would be temporarily delayed and that the company planned to restart production on Feb. 10. The $2 billion (1.5 billion pounds) factory is a key part of Chief Executive Elon Musk’s plan to make more than half a million automobiles this year.  Needham analyst Rajvindra Gill, who recommends selling Tesla, warned in a report that Tesla’s stock is trading at extreme price-to-earnings multiples compared to many leading technology companies. Even after Wednesday’s drop, Tesla is trading at about 55 times expected 2021 net income, compared to Amazon (AMZN.O) at 49, Apple (AAPL.O) at 22 and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) at 23, according to Refinitiv data. “We’ve never seen a stock rise that much that fast with such little regard to past fundamentals or track record,” Gill wrote.  Tesla last week said it expected a delay of up to a week and a half in the ramp-up of Model 3 production at the Shanghai plant after the Chinese government ordered it to shut the factory due to the outbreak. The coronavirus outbreak has disrupted business across China, with the government there saying that the death toll had reached 490 as of Tuesday, up 65 from the previous day. “Given the 3,000 per week China Model 3 production expectations in a country that remains on lockdown, we feel a reset of expectations in Q1 is likely and thus needs to be reflected in the valuation,” Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a report, leaving his price target unchanged at $750 per share. The stock was last down 17% at about $738. Wednesday’s drop followed a sudden selloff in the final minutes of a rally on Tuesday that still left the stock up almost 14% in that session.  Tesla’s rally of over 300% since early June has been a vindication for Musk, who has transformed a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories.  Still, many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth in the face of competition from established rivals including BMW (BMWG.DE) and Volkswagen (VOWG.DE). Even many Tesla bulls question the stock’s valuation following its recent, electrifying surge.  Barclays analyst Brian Johnson maintained his “underweight” rating on Tesla while raising his price target to $300 from $200.

REUTERS/Aly Song “We continue to believe TSLA is fundamentally overvalued – but nevertheless concede that the recent price action opens up the possibility of raising capital cheaply, and hence reduces that chance of a stalled business,” Johnson wrote in a client note. Following Canaccord’s downgrade, nine analysts recommend buying Tesla’s stock, while 11 analysts are neutral and 15 analysts recommend selling, according to Refinitiv. The median price target of analysts is $390.

FILE PHOTO: The Tesla logo is seen on a car in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 9, 2020.  REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoThe decision marks a step forward for Texas as it vies with Oklahoma to attract a new factory to build Tesla’s Y sport utility vehicles and cybertrucks.  A majority of commissioners in Travis County voted in favor of providing the electric carmaker with a tax rebate worth at least $14.7 million.  That brings the total amount of tax rebates to nearly $65 million after the Del Valle school district, which includes the proposed factory site, approved a $50 million incentive on Thursday. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The electric carmaker only has a single vehicle manufacturing plant in California and has said it wants to start building a large second plant in the southwestern United States as early as the third quarter of this year.. Commissioners in favor of the agreement decided to move forward after a Tesla representative said executives had met with the governor of a rival state, without naming the state. The city of Tulsa in Oklahoma has campaigned for Tesla to build the plant there. Tesla has asked Travis County for an 80% rebate on its property taxes for 10 years, worth $14.7 million, as well as a 65% rebate for the next 10 years after that. Tesla said the factory would create 5,000 jobs, mostly low-skilled. The average annual salary would be roughly $47,000, an income considered low by the county’s health and human services division.

Musk has often taken umbrage at short-sellers and in 2018 sent a box of shorts to hedge fund owner and Tesla short-seller David Einhorn. The “Short Shorts” on the Tesla shop website feature gold trim and “S3XY” in gold across the back, which also happens to be formed from Tesla model names. The shorts cost $69.420, the last three digits an apparent reference to Musk’s infamous tweet in 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share, with 420 also a code word for marijuana. That tweet landed him in hot water with the U.S. securities regulator, costing him his position as Tesla chairman. The Silicon Valley car maker, however, has reason to crow. Its stock has almost tripled in value this year to just over $1,200 per share and it sold more than 90,000 of its electric vehicles in the second quarter, defying a trend of plummeting sales for other automakers hit by coronavirus-induced lockdowns.  “Run like the wind or entertain like Liberace,” the product description says, adding: “Enjoy exceptional comfort from the closing bell.” It will ship within 2-4 weeks. Tesla is expected to announce earnings results for April-June quarter this month, with analysts saying the second-quarter deliveries had heightened expectations that it will report four consecutive quarters of profit for the first time in its history.

Tesla Vice President Tao Lin said on the Weibo social media platform that car deliveries from its new Shanghai plant would be temporarily delayed and that the company planned to restart production on Feb 10. The $2 billion factory is a key part of Chief Executive Elon Musk’s plan to make more than half a million automobiles this year. Tesla last week said it expected a delay of up to a week and a half in the ramp-up of Model 3 production at the plant after the government ordered it to shut the factory due to the outbreak. The coronavirus has disrupted business across China, with the government there saying another 65 people had died as of Tuesday, the highest daily total yet. “Given the 3,000 per week China Model 3 production expectations in a country that remains on lockdown, we feel a reset of expectations in Q1 is likely and thus needs to be reflected in the valuation,” Canaccord analyst Jed Dorsheimer wrote in a report, leaving his price target unchanged at $750 per share. The stock was last down 19% at $716.39. Tesla’s rally of over 300% since early June has been a vindication for Musk, who has transformed a niche car maker with production problems into the global leader in electric vehicles, with U.S. and Chinese factories. Still, many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth in the face of competition from established rivals including BMW and Volkswagen. Even many Tesla bulls question the stock’s valuation following its recent, electrifying surge. Following Canaccord’s downgrade, nine analysts recommend buying Tesla’s stock, while 11 analysts are neutral and 15 analysts recommend selling, according to Refinitiv. The median price target of analysts is $390.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) appears on the verge of joining the S&P 500, a major accomplishment for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk that would unleash a flood of new demand for the electric car maker’s shares, which have already surged 500% over the past year.  Higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, announced last week, have analysts increasingly confident the company will show a profit in its quarterly report on July 22. That would mark Tesla’s first cumulative four-quarter profit, a key hurdle to be added to the S&P 500.  With a market capitalization of about $250 billion, Tesla would be among the most valuable companies ever added to the S&P 500, larger than 95% of the index’s existing components. It would have a major impact on investment funds that track the index. Tesla potentially in the S&P 500 here While analysts and investors have recently become more confident of Tesla’s addition, a S&P Dow Jones Indices spokeswoman declined to comment about specific changes to the index. Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, had to look back to the dot-com era to recall a comparable situation. In 1999, Yahoo surged 64% in five trading days between the announcement that it would be added to the index on Nov. 30 and its inclusion after the close of trading on Dec. 7. Yahoo’s market capitalization at the time was about $56 billion. Yahoo's 1999 S&P 500 debut here(1).png “The lesson learned from Yahoo was that when you have an up and coming issue that may possibly go into the index, you should already own a little of it,” said Silverblatt. “If you had to get into that stock, you were paying a heck of a premium compared to owning it a week earlier.” Funds that attempt to identically track the S&P 500 have at least $4.4 trillion of assets, according to S&P Dow Jones  Indices, and those funds would need to buy Tesla shares quickly to avoid errors tracking the index’s performance. Ivan Cajic, head of index & ETF research at Virtu Financial estimates index managers would need to own roughly 25 million shares of Tesla stock, currently worth $34 billion. “You have all the index funds that have no choice but to include it,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “That is one reason why it has been so strong here, in anticipation of that.”  Additionally, actively managed investment funds that benchmark their performance to the S&P 500 will be forced to decide whether to buy Tesla shares. Such funds manage trillions of dollars in additional assets. “Even if you don’t like Tesla and you think it’s overvalued, the fact that it is going into the index would mean trillions of dollars would have some kind of position,” said Jim Bianco, head of Bianco Research in Chicago. “As part of their benchmark, portfolio managers would not be able to ignore it.” Up 43% in just the past eight sessions, Tesla is among the most loved - and hated - stocks on Wall Street. It is the U.S. stock market’s purest play bet on the rise of renewable energy and the decline of fossil fuels, and Tesla’s Model 3 sedan has made major inroads among consumers. As Tesla rallies, short bets hit record levels here However, short sellers are betting $19 billion that Tesla’s shares will fall, the largest short level on record for a U.S. company, in dollars, according to S3 Partners.  The Tesla logo is seen on a car in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 9, 2020.  REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/FilesBears point to looming competition from Porsche, General Motors (GM.N) and other longer-established rivals. They are also skeptical of Tesla’s corporate governance under Musk, who in 2018 agreed to pay $20 million and step down as chairman to settle fraud charges.  Traders betting Tesla could be added to the S&P 500 have almost certainly contributed to the recent rally. However, Bianco warned that the stock could reverse if Tesla is not added to the S&P 500.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) appears on the verge of joining the S&P 500, a major accomplishment for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk that would unleash a flood of new demand for the electric car maker’s shares, which have already surged 500% over the past year.  Higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, announced last week, have analysts increasingly confident the company will show a profit in its quarterly report on July 22. That would mark Tesla’s first cumulative four-quarter profit, a key hurdle to be added to the S&P 500.  With a market capitalization of about $250 billion, Tesla would be among the most valuable companies ever added to the S&P 500, larger than 95% of the index’s existing components. It would have a major impact on investment funds that track the index. Tesla potentially in the S&P 500 here While analysts and investors have recently become more confident of Tesla’s addition, a S&P Dow Jones Indices spokeswoman declined to comment about specific changes to the index. Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, had to look back to the dot-com era to recall a comparable situation. In 1999, Yahoo surged 64% in five trading days between the announcement that it would be added to the index on Nov. 30 and its inclusion after the close of trading on Dec. 7. Yahoo’s market capitalization at the time was about $56 billion. Yahoo's 1999 S&P 500 debut here(1).png “The lesson learned from Yahoo was that when you have an up and coming issue that may possibly go into the index, you should already own a little of it,” said Silverblatt. “If you had to get into that stock, you were paying a heck of a premium compared to owning it a week earlier.” Funds that attempt to identically track the S&P 500 have at least $4.4 trillion of assets, according to S&P Dow Jones  Indices, and those funds would need to buy Tesla shares quickly to avoid errors tracking the index’s performance. Ivan Cajic, head of index & ETF research at Virtu Financial estimates index managers would need to own roughly 25 million shares of Tesla stock, currently worth $34 billion. “You have all the index funds that have no choice but to include it,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “That is one reason why it has been so strong here, in anticipation of that.”  Additionally, actively managed investment funds that benchmark their performance to the S&P 500 will be forced to decide whether to buy Tesla shares. Such funds manage trillions of dollars in additional assets. “Even if you don’t like Tesla and you think it’s overvalued, the fact that it is going into the index would mean trillions of dollars would have some kind of position,” said Jim Bianco, head of Bianco Research in Chicago. “As part of their benchmark, portfolio managers would not be able to ignore it.” Up 43% in just the past eight sessions, Tesla is among the most loved - and hated - stocks on Wall Street. It is the U.S. stock market’s purest play bet on the rise of renewable energy and the decline of fossil fuels, and Tesla’s Model 3 sedan has made major inroads among consumers. As Tesla rallies, short bets hit record levels here However, short sellers are betting $19 billion that Tesla’s shares will fall, the largest short level on record for a U.S. company, in dollars, according to S3 Partners.  The Tesla logo is seen on a car in Los Angeles, California, U.S., July 9, 2020.  REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/FilesBears point to looming competition from Porsche, General Motors (GM.N) and other longer-established rivals. They are also skeptical of Tesla’s corporate governance under Musk, who in 2018 agreed to pay $20 million and step down as chairman to settle fraud charges.  Traders betting Tesla could be added to the S&P 500 have almost certainly contributed to the recent rally. However, Bianco warned that the stock could reverse if Tesla is not added to the S&P 500.

Musk has often taken umbrage at short-sellers and in 2018 sent a box of shorts to hedge fund owner and Tesla short-seller David Einhorn. The “Short Shorts” on the Tesla shop website feature gold trim and “S3XY” in gold across the back, which also happens to be formed from Tesla model names. The shorts cost $69.420, the last three digits an apparent reference to Musk’s infamous tweet in 2018 that he was considering taking Tesla private for $420 per share, with 420 also a code word for marijuana. That tweet landed him in hot water with the U.S. securities regulator, costing him his position as Tesla chairman. The Silicon Valley car maker, however, has reason to crow. Its stock has almost tripled in value this year to just over $1,200 per share and it sold more than 90,000 of its electric vehicles in the second quarter, defying a trend of plummeting sales for other automakers hit by coronavirus-induced lockdowns.  “Run like the wind or entertain like Liberace,” the product description says, adding: “Enjoy exceptional comfort from the closing bell.” It will ship within 2-4 weeks. Tesla is expected to announce earnings results for April-June quarter this month, with analysts saying the second-quarter deliveries had heightened expectations that it will report four consecutive quarters of profit for the first time in its history.

REUTERS/Aly Song/File PhotoSHANGHAI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has launched a hiring spree in Shanghai with plans to bring on designers at its China studio and about 1,000 factory workers, job posts show, as the U.S. electric vehicle maker ramps up production in the world’s biggest auto market. The posts on the Tesla human resources department’s official WeChat account mark the first time the California-based automaker has looked to hire designers in China. Tesla said in January it planned to open a design and research centre in China to make “Chinese-style” cars. The posts did not reveal how many designers Tesla planned to hire. The company also planned to hire 600 workers at stamping, bodywork, painting and assembly workshops in Shanghai, according to a separate job post by the Lingang local government. Another 150 workers were needed for quality checks, 200 for logistics work and 20 for security, it added. Two sources familiar with the matter said the recruitment drive was partly for the preparation of Model Y sport-utility vehicles at the Shanghai plant. Tesla is building manufacturing facilities for Model Ys in Shanghai from next year. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company delivered over 30,000 units in China in the past quarter, most of them locally made Model 3 sedans.  In March it advertised for solar and energy storage project managers in China, as it moves to expand its energy business into the country.

The design for the ventilators relies heavily on Tesla car parts, one of the engineers said, enabling the company to redeploy existing stock and produce the devices quickly.  The video comes two weeks after Chief Executive Elon Musk said Tesla planned to reopen its New York factory to produce ventilators. The timeline for production was not specified in the video. “There’s still a lot of work to do,” said one of the engineers, “but we’re giving it our best effort.” Governments globally have appealed to automakers and aerospace companies to help procure or make ventilators and other medical equipment amid the increasing number of coronavirus infections.  More than a million people have been infected worldwide by the coronavirus, while over 65,000 have been killed. The United States has the most number of cases at above 300,000. On March 30, Ford Motor Co (F.N) said it would produce 50,000 ventilators in the following 100 days at a plant in Michigan in cooperation with General Electric’s (GE.N) healthcare unit, and could then build 30,000 per month as needed.

More than a million people have been infected worldwide by the coronavirus, while over 65,000 have been killed. The United States has the most number of cases at above 300,000. On March 30, Ford Motor Co (F.N) said it would produce 50,000 ventilators in the following 100 days at a plant in Michigan in cooperation with General Electric’s (GE.N) healthcare unit, and could then build 30,000 per month as needed.

There were no environmentalists holding up the process, Tesla’s spokeswoman Kathrin Schira said in a statement.

A local court on Thursday stepped in and rejected environmentalist efforts to stop the land being cleared of trees, adding its ruling could not be appealed.

REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo (This June 4 story corrects to read Tesla, paragraphs 1,2) (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk on Thursday called for Amazon.com Inc to be broken up, after an author complained on social media about being unable to self-publish a book via the world’s largest online retailer. “This is insane @JeffBezos,” Musk tweeted at Amazon’s chief. Both men are billionaires and oversee competing space exploration companies on top of their duties at Tesla and Amazon. “Time to break up Amazon. Monopolies are wrong!” Musk added in a second tweet. Musk does not have legal authority to break up Amazon. The retailer had no comment on Musk’s call for its dissolution but said the book in question, by author Alex Berenson, had been blocked in error and was now available for sale via its Kindle e-reading service. The decision to greenlight the book’s sale was not due to Musk, Amazon said. The Tesla chief, who earlier this month said he would take a break from Twitter, has a history of being outspoken on the social media platform. A tweet in 2018 that he had secured funding to take Tesla private led to a lawsuit against Musk by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which the parties later settled. Musk has lashed out about shelter-at-home restrictions to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus as well. According to a photo of a message Amazon sent Berenson, posted on Twitter, the retailer had taken action because the 22-page book did not comply with guidelines that Amazon did not specify, adding, “we are referring customers to official sources for health information about the virus.” Berenson’s book is titled, “Unreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns: Part 1: Introduction and Death Counts and Estimates.” Berenson did not respond to an email requesting comment.

REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File PhotoFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Tesla bought hospital ventilators in China and shipped them to the United States, CEO Elon Musk said on Tuesday. Tesla’s purchase comes as governments across the globe appeal to automakers and aerospace companies help procure or make ventilators and other medical equipment. “China had an oversupply, so we bought 1255 FDA-approved ResMed, Philips & Medtronic ventilators on Friday night & airshipped them to LA,” Musk said on Twitter. California Governor Gavin Newsom on Tuesday said the state would receive 1,000 ventilators from Tesla as the United States braces to deal with an influx of patients infected by the coronavirus. Authorities are hoping large-scale manufacturers can use their low-cost supply chains and digital design expertise, including 3D printing, and repurpose some factories in order to make up the expected shortfall in vital medical hardware. Carmakers have cautioned that assembling delicate medical equipment to standards adequate for use in hospital intensive care units remains a challenge.

REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke/File Photo (This June 4 story corrects to read Tesla, paragraphs 1,2) (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk on Thursday called for Amazon.com Inc to be broken up, after an author complained on social media about being unable to self-publish a book via the world’s largest online retailer. “This is insane @JeffBezos,” Musk tweeted at Amazon’s chief. Both men are billionaires and oversee competing space exploration companies on top of their duties at Tesla and Amazon. “Time to break up Amazon. Monopolies are wrong!” Musk added in a second tweet. Musk does not have legal authority to break up Amazon. The retailer had no comment on Musk’s call for its dissolution but said the book in question, by author Alex Berenson, had been blocked in error and was now available for sale via its Kindle e-reading service. The decision to greenlight the book’s sale was not due to Musk, Amazon said. The Tesla chief, who earlier this month said he would take a break from Twitter, has a history of being outspoken on the social media platform. A tweet in 2018 that he had secured funding to take Tesla private led to a lawsuit against Musk by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which the parties later settled. Musk has lashed out about shelter-at-home restrictions to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus as well.

REUTERS/Aly Song NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk’s fortunes have sure turned around fast. Just last June shares in Tesla, the electric-car maker he runs, had halved in six months as investors doubted whether a recent capital raise was enough; short-sellers pontificated about the imminent collapse of the company. Seven months and a near-160% gain later, though, and Tesla shares have hit a new high, and the company is worth just shy of $90 billion. That, like one of the acceleration settings on its cars, is ludicrous. There are reasons for optimism. The maker of the Model 3 finally hit one of Musk’s targets, delivering just enough cars last quarter to squeeze past the lower end of his goal of 360,000 to 400,000 for the year. And its factory in China is up and running, having taken less than a year to build, and can produce up to 500,000 vehicles a year. Justifying the stock price, though, requires steadfastly believing in one of two developments. The first is that Musk will soon have his company routinely selling some 3 million cars a year. That calculation is based on Tesla managing to improve its pre-tax margin, which in the third quarter was a lowly 2.8%, to around 7.6% and that as a mature, rather than fast-growing, company it trades at 8.6 times earnings – both metrics a blend of luxury carmakers BMW and Daimler, and the best-performing mass-producer, Toyota Motor. It also assumes a 21% tax rate and that carmaking accounts for the vast majority of Tesla’s revenue. Those assumptions don’t have to be anywhere near so heady if the company is close to becoming a robo-taxi giant. Musk himself has pledged there will be 1 million self-driving-enabled Teslas on the road in 2020. Its owners could rent them out when not using them, with Musk’s outfit taking a cut as well as running its own fleet. The latter could, over time, bring in 10 times as much revenue as just selling the car, General Motors reckons.  Trouble is, neither is realistic any time soon. The first would require a more than eightfold increase in production, way beyond Tesla’s current or planned capacity; the second demands regulatory approval and then customer acceptance that at present looks many years off. The most recent sales targets aside, Musk’s track record at delivering on promises is abysmal. At this point, shareholders are parking their money on a hope and a promise.

Just last June shares in Tesla, the electric-car maker he runs, had halved in six months as investors doubted whether a recent capital raise was enough; short-sellers pontificated about the imminent collapse of the company. Seven months and a near-160% gain later, though, and Tesla shares have hit a new high, and the company is worth just shy of $90 billion. That, like one of the acceleration settings on its cars, is ludicrous. There are reasons for optimism. The maker of the Model 3 finally hit one of Musk’s targets, delivering just enough cars last quarter to squeeze past the lower end of his goal of 360,000 to 400,000 for the year. And its factory in China is up and running, having taken less than a year to build, and can produce up to 500,000 vehicles a year. Justifying the stock price, though, requires steadfastly believing in one of two developments. The first is that Musk will soon have his company routinely selling some 3 million cars a year. That calculation is based on Tesla managing to improve its pre-tax margin, which in the third quarter was a lowly 2.8%, to around 7.6% and that as a mature, rather than fast-growing, company it trades at 8.6 times earnings – both metrics a blend of luxury carmakers BMW and Daimler, and the best-performing mass-producer, Toyota Motor. It also assumes a 21% tax rate and that carmaking accounts for the vast majority of Tesla’s revenue. Those assumptions don’t have to be anywhere near so heady if the company is close to becoming a robo-taxi giant. Musk himself has pledged there will be 1 million self-driving-enabled Teslas on the road in 2020. Its owners could rent them out when not using them, with Musk’s outfit taking a cut as well as running its own fleet. The latter could, over time, bring in 10 times as much revenue as just selling the car, General Motors reckons.  Trouble is, neither is realistic any time soon. The first would require a more than eightfold increase in production, way beyond Tesla’s current or planned capacity; the second demands regulatory approval and then customer acceptance that at present looks many years off. The most recent sales targets aside, Musk’s track record at delivering on promises is abysmal. At this point, shareholders are parking their money on a hope and a promise.

REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch(Reuters) - Tesla Inc has signed a three-year pricing deal with Japan’s Panasonic Corp relating to the manufacture and supply of lithium-ion battery cells at the Gigafactory in Nevada, the electric carmaker disclosed in a filing on Tuesday. Tesla and Panasonic have been reported to be in talks to expand the battery joint venture’s capacity. Panasonic hinted in May that it was working to develop new batteries with Tesla, possibly with higher capacity. Tesla said the deal, signed last week and effective April 1, 2020, sets the terms for production capacity commitments by Panasonic and purchase volume commitments by Tesla over the first two years of the agreement. Tesla also amended the general terms and conditions of its partnership with Panasonic, modifying the term to expire 10 years after Panasonic achieves certain manufacturing milestones. Panasonic is no longer Tesla’s exclusive battery supplier, but has been able to turn around the U.S. joint battery business as demand for Tesla’s electric cars soar. Last month, Tesla reported its third consecutive quarterly profit despite the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, taking investors by surprise.

REUTERS/Aly SongWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tesla Inc and the state of Michigan confirmed Wednesday they have resolved the company’s 2016 lawsuit challenging the state’s refusal to allow the company to sell vehicles directly to consumers. The Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office said a resolution filed in U.S. District Court recognizes “that any Michigan resident may lawfully buy a Tesla and have it serviced in Michigan.” The stipulation also says Tesla may “operate under existing Michigan law; sell cars to Michigan customers as long as the sales contract indicates the sale took place in a state other than Michigan; and, indirectly own service and repair facilities in Michigan through a subsidiary, Tesla Michigan.” Reuters and other outlets reported the expected settlement on Tuesday. Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not sell its vehicles through a network of independent dealers. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk reacted to the settlement on Twitter writing: “Yay!” Tesla has filed a number of legal challenges over the years to state laws that prohibit or heavily restrict the ability of automakers to sell vehicles directly to consumers. The stipulation says Tesla may operate galleries in Michigan to “educate customers and facilitate transactions out-of-state.” Tesla may conduct demonstration drives, discuss prices, service, financing, leasing, and trade-ins with potential customers and facilitate “ordering and purchase of a vehicle for which legal title transfers out-of-state.” Tesla agreed to drop its suit and Michigan officials agreed to “take no enforcement action against Tesla or any Tesla  subsidiary” as long as it abided by the terms of the court papers.

The latest leg of Tesla’s rally comes after the company on Saturday cut the price of its Model Y sport utility vehicle by $3,000, just four months after its launch, as it tries to maintain sales momentum in the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher-than-expected second-quarter vehicle deliveries, announced earlier this month, have some analysts and investors expecting the company will show a profit in its quarterly report on July 22. That would mark Tesla’s first cumulative four-quarter profit, a key requirement for it to be added to the S&P 500. Monday’s surge added $24 billion to Tesla’s stock market value, an increase approaching General Motors Co’s entire value of $35 billion. With its market capitalization now at $310 billion, Tesla would be among the most valuable companies ever added to the S&P 500. It would be more valuable than 95% of the index’s existing components and about even with Procter & Gamble Co. Adding Tesla to the S&P 500 would have a major impact on investment funds that track the index, forcing them to buy tens of billions of dollars worth of Tesla’s stock. Since late June, demand for bullish call options on Tesla shares has been greater than demand for protective put options, which traders warn is a sign of exuberance. Tesla on Friday set its annual shareholder meeting for Sept. 22 at its Fremont factory in California. The same day would also be “Battery Day,” when Tesla it is expected to reveal significant advances in battery technology. Tesla’s stock rose as much as 16% earlier on Monday, and it has gained about 600% over the past year.

Tesla will determine the battery purchase volume between July 2020 and June 2022, according to its own needs, CATL said in a stock exchange filing, adding the agreement does not impose restrictions on Tesla’s purchase volume. Tesla, which has a long-standing battery supply agreement with Japan’s Panasonic Corp (6752.T), said during its earnings call last week that its pact with LG Chem (051910.KS) and CATL was at a smaller scale. Tesla is building Model 3 vehicles from its $2 billion Shanghai factory, which started delivering cars last year, and has said it would diversify battery supplies for the plant.

Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not sell its vehicles through a network of independent dealers.

Shares of Tesla Inc jumped more than 8% on Monday, putting Tesla’s market capitalization at $141.1 billion at the close. More importantly for Musk, Tesla’s stock market value reached a six-month average of $100.2 billion, according to an analysis of Refinitiv data. Hitting a six-month average of $100 billion triggers the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire to buy Tesla stock as part of a pay package agreed in 2018. Musk has already met two other requirements by hitting a growth target and far exceeding a one-month average $100 billion market cap. Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each. At Tesla’s closing stock price of $761.19, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares for a profit of $694 million. Musk on Friday said on Twitter, “Tesla stock price is too high imo,” using an abbreviation for “in my opinion”. That tweet sent Tesla’s stock tumbling 10%, shocking shareholders. Tesla, whose California factory is closed as part of the state’s coronavirus-related lockdowns, posted its third quarterly profit in a row last week. Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, receives no salary or cash bonus, only options that vest based on Tesla’s market cap and milestones for revenue and profit growth.

When Tesla unveiled Musk’s package in 2018, it said he could theoretically reap as much as $55.8 billion if no new shares were issued. However, Tesla has since issued shares to compensate employees, and last year it sold $2.7 billion in shares and convertible bonds. Musk’s subsequent options tranches would vest at $50 billion increments of Tesla market capitalization over the agreement’s 10-year period, with the billionaire earning the full package if Tesla’s market capitalization reaches $650 billion and the high tech vehicle maker achieves several revenue and profit targets.

Shares of Tesla Inc jumped more than 8% on Monday, putting Tesla’s market capitalization at $141.1 billion at the close. More importantly for Musk, Tesla’s stock market value reached a six-month average of $100.2 billion, according to an analysis of Refinitiv data. Hitting a six-month average of $100 billion triggers the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to the billionaire to buy Tesla stock as part of a pay package agreed in 2018. Musk has already met two other requirements by hitting a growth target and far exceeding a one-month average $100 billion market cap. Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 1.69 million Tesla shares at $350.02 each. At Tesla’s closing stock price of $761.19, Musk would theoretically be able to sell the shares for a profit of $694 million. Musk on Friday said on Twitter, “Tesla stock price is too high imo,” using an abbreviation for “in my opinion”. That tweet sent Tesla’s stock tumbling 10%, shocking shareholders. Tesla, whose California factory is closed as part of the state’s coronavirus-related lockdowns, posted its third quarterly profit in a row last week. Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, receives no salary or cash bonus, only options that vest based on Tesla’s market cap and milestones for revenue and profit growth.
