0,AMD,"April 25, 2012","                TEXT-S&P raises Advanced Micro Devices rating to 'BB-' - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsIndiaSouth AsiaTVMoreIndia Regulatory NewsApril 25, 2012 /  3:57 PM / 8 years agoTEXT-S&P raises Advanced Micro Devices rating to 'BB-'9 Min ReadOverview	     -- U.S. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced in February 2012 itsplans to de-lever through repayment of $485 million notes due August 2012.	     -- AMD recently amended its wafer supply agreement with foundry partner 	GLOBALFOUNDRIES in March 2012 and as a result, AMD may source 28 nanometer 	wafers from alternate suppliers, to the potential benefit of its revenues and 	operating profitability.	     -- We are raising our corporate credit and senior unsecured issue ratings 	on AMD to 'BB-' from 'B+', removing the ratings from CreditWatch Positive.	     -- The stable outlook reflects our expectation that AMD's financial 	profile will offset ongoing and considerable business risk.   		Rating Action	On April 25, 2012, Standard & Poor's Rating Services raised its corporate 	credit and senior unsecured issue ratings on Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Advanced 	Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) to 'BB-' from 'B+'. At the same time, we removed the 	ratings from CreditWatch, where they were placed with positive implications on 	Jan. 31, 2012. The rating outlook is stable.		The upgrade reflects AMD's improved financial profile, along with an improved 	business risk profile. It also reflects the company's prospects for further 	revenue, earnings, and market share stability, given improved execution of 	wafer supply from GLOBALFOUNDRIES (GF), recent contractual amendments with GF, 	and AMD's commitment to ample product development spending. 		AMD maintains a simple capital structure, composed of a modest amount of 	capital leases (about $30 million outstanding at March 31, 2012) and about 	$2.1 billion of senior unsecured notes, due between 2012 and 2020, including 	two senior unsecured convertible note tranches. We rate AMD's senior unsecured 	notes at 'BB-' (the same as the corporate credit rating) with a recovery 	rating of '3', indicating average (30%-50%) of recovery in the event of a 	payment default. 		Rationale	The 'BB-' corporate credit rating on AMD reflects the company's ""weak"" 	business risk profile, characterized by intense competition from Intel Corp. 	and the threat of competition from ARM-based (a type of computing instruction 	set) competitors, partly offset by AMD's ""significant"" financial risk profile, 	with considerable support provided by its lightly leveraged balance sheet and 	""adequate"" liquidity. Our assessment of the company's business risk profile 	also incorporates AMD's commitment to R&D spending, which we expect will 	continue to represent about 22% of revenue.		We expect smartphone and computing tablet growth will reduce demand for 	x86-based (a family of computing instruction set architectures) computing and 	will support cloud-based server demand. We expect x86-based and server demand 	will provide AMD an opportunity to achieve further revenue and profit growth. 	We expect that AMD's revenue growth will remain constrained by competition 	from Intel, given Intel's ""strong"" business risk profile. With about $6.5 	billion revenues and $930 million EBITDA for the latest 12 months ended March 	31, 2012, AMD possesses a relatively modest x86 unit and revenue market share 	relative to Intel, which has much larger share (about 95% unit share) in 	server markets, as well as 85% unit share in notebook markets, and over 75% 	unit share in desktop markets, as measured by IDC. 		AMD faces challenges as well by ARM-based competitors, which are currently 	designing products for fast-growing tablet and smartphone markets. We expect 	tablet markets will grow to represent in excess of 25% of collective PC and 	tablet units worldwide over the next several years and will constrain, but not 	eliminate, AMD's prospects for revenue and profit growth.		We have revised our business risk profile for AMD to weak from ""vulnerable,"" 	reflecting our anticipation of further profit stability and growth due to the 	company's recent wafer amendment with GF, which provides AMD with greater 	flexibility to source wafers from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd 	(TSMC), if needed. AMD's EBITDA margins have stabilized over the past several 	years at about 15%, following the company's divestiture of its manufacturing 	assets to GF. We expect AMD's R&D spending will continue to represent about 	22% of revenues in the future, given the brevity of industry product 	lifecycles and intense competition.		We have revised our financial risk profile for AMD to significant from 	""aggressive,"" reflecting the company's improving financial metrics, including 	debt to EBITDA of about 2.3x as of March 31, 2012, adjusted for operating 	leases and stock compensation, as well as strong free cash flow in excess of 	about $400 million annually since September 2011. We expect AMD's financial 	leverage will decline to about 1.9x after the anticipated debt reduction later 	in 2012. Although the company's financial metrics currently appear stronger 	than indicated by our financial risk assessment, its relatively short track 	record at current levels and execution risks in highly competitive markets 	drive its weak financial risk profile. 		Considering AMD's outsourced manufacturing business model, we expect that 	capital expenditures will continue to represent only about 4% of revenues and 	free cash flow will amount to about $500 million annually. 		Liquidity	AMD maintains adequate liquidity from internal sources. The company currently 	has no plans to obtain a revolving credit facility. Cash and marketable 	securities amounted to $1.7 billion at March 31, 2012, down about $200 million 	from about $1.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2011, due primarily to about $293 million 	cash spent to acquire SeaMicro, a server provider to cloud-based computing 	markets, in the March quarter. We expect that AMD, given its liquidity 	profile, will be able to fund remaining nonrecurring amendment payments to GF 	(about $275 million through the March quarter of 2013), repay its August 2012 	notes' maturity ($485 million), and maintain cash above its minimum target of 	$1.5 billion.		Our assessment of AMD's liquidity profile incorporates the following 	expectations, assumptions, and factors:	     -- We expect coverage of uses to be in excess of 1.2x for the next 12 to 	24 months.	     -- We believe that net sources would be positive in the near term, even 	with a 15% to 20% decline in EBITDA.	     -- Debt maturities are well paced, with maturities of less than $600 	million in any one year and spread through 2020. AMD plans to limit debt 	maturities to no more than $500 million per year as part of its long-term 	capital structure goal. 		Recovery analysis	For the complete recovery analysis, please see our recovery report on AMD, to 	be published separately on RatingsDirect.		Outlook	The outlook is stable. We expect AMD's financial profile to offset ongoing and 	considerable business risk. A rating downgrade could result from a number of 	developments, including sharply lower demand, erosion of market share, or 	weaker manufacturing execution. Any of these scenarios could weaken the 	financial profile that supports the rating. Specifically, we would consider a 	lower rating if liquidity fell below $1 billion or if leverage was on a 	trajectory to exceed 3x. 		We would consider a higher rating once AMD builds a track record of stable to 	growing market share and earnings have been well established, leading us to 	conclude the leverage could remain over time at or below 2x. Given AMD's 	competitive and cyclical operating environment, an upgrade is unlikely over at 	least the next 12 to 18 months.

0,AMD,"January 30, 2013","                TEXT - Fitch cuts Advanced Micro Devices issuer default rating - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsIndiaSouth AsiaTVMoreIndia Regulatory NewsJanuary 30, 2013 /  7:48 PM / 8 years agoTEXT - Fitch cuts Advanced Micro Devices issuer default rating6 Min ReadJan 30 - Fitch Ratings has downgraded the following ratings for AdvancedMicro Devices Inc.'s (NYSE: AMD):--Long-term IDR to 'CCC' from 'B';--Senior unsecured debt to 'CCC/RR4' from 'B/RR4'. Fitch's actions affect approximately $2.1 billion of total debt.The ratings reflect Fitch's expectations that negative free cash flow (FCF) in 2013 will drive cash below AMD's target level and potentially approach the company's minimum operating level. Beyond the near-term, Fitch believes a strongend market recovery and adoption of AMD's new products will be required to preserve cash during the company's multi-year transformation. Fitch expects negative revenue growth in the mid- to high-teens for 2013, drivenby weak consumer spending, robust tablet penetration and lingering excess channel inventory anticipated for the first half of the year. Revenue growth could turn positive in the back half of 2013, assuming strong sales of AMD's newproducts.Negative revenue growth will drive profitability lower in 2013, despite restructuring actions expected to reduce quarterly operating expenses to $450 million by the September 2013 quarter. Fitch expects negative FCF of $250 million to $450 million in 2013 from lower profitability levels and inventory builds related to new product ramps.AMD's cash usage will be amplified by cash payments to GLOBALFOUNDRIES (GF) for amendments to the wafer supply agreement (WSA), including $215 million in fiscal2013 and $200 million at the beginning of fiscal 2014. These cash outflows couldbe partially offset by proceeds from AMD's proposed office building sale-and-leaseback transaction.AMD is planning first half of 2013 launches of system-on-a-chip (SoC) accelerated processors for ultra-low power mobility and tablet products and solid revenue growth in the second of 2013 from ramps of a broad set of design wins. Delays to these launches, the expected market recovery, or product sales ramps would exacerbate Fitch forecasts.Credit protection measures will remain volatile, due to variations in profitability. Fitch estimates total leverage was 4.2x for 2012 but may approach10x in 2013. Fitch estimates interest coverage was 2.8x for 2012 but could fall to 1x in 2013.AMD's transformation targets higher-growth markets, including ultra-low-power mobility, high-density servers and semi-custom embedded products. Given AMD's traditional PC markets represent the vast majority of sales, achieving the company's target of 40%-50% of sales from higher-growth markets will require a number of years.Fitch believes liquidity was sufficient as of Dec. 29, 2012, and consisted of $1.18 billion of cash and cash equivalents, including $181 million of long-term marketable securities. Fitch expects negative FCF of $250 million to $450 million for the current year, pressuring liquidity by the end 2013. The company has a stated target cash level of $1.1 billion and minimum operating cash level of $700 million. Total debt was $2.1 billion at Dec. 29, 2012 and consisted of:--$580 million of 6% senior unsecured convertible notes due 2015;--$500 million of 8.125% senior unsecured notes due 2017;--$500 million of 7.75% senior unsecured notes due 2020;--$500 million of 7.5% senior unsecured notes due 2022; --Approximately $25 million of capital leases.AMD's ratings continue to be supported by: --Low capital intensity as a fabless semiconductor maker, resulting in a stronger FCF profile; --Reduced revenue breakeven profitability, pro forma for the completion of current restructuring initiatives; --The company's role as the only current viable alternative microprocessor supplier to Intel, although Fitch expects new entrants in certain markets over the intermediate term.Fitch's concerns center on:--Limited financial flexibility, given cash usage trends;--AMD's modest share of the overall PC market and limited share in rapidly growing small-form factor mobility products; --High R&D intensity as a fabless semiconductor maker.Further negative rating actions could be taken if the penetration of new APU products is lackluster, resulting in revenue declines and cash usage beyond 2013. Positive rating actions could occur if:--FCF exceeds the upper end of Fitch's base case range; --Strong adoption of new products, portending solid revenue growth and positive FCF in 2014.AMD's Recovery Ratings (RRs) reflect Fitch's belief that the company would be reorganized rather than liquidated in a bankruptcy scenario. This is given Fitch's estimates that AMD's reorganization value of approximately $1 billion exceeds a projected liquidation value of $682 million. To arrive at a reorganization value, Fitch assumes a 4x reorganization multiple and applies it to its estimate of distressed operating EBITDA of $260 million, which covers estimated annual fixed charges, resulting in an adjusted reorganization value of $939 million after subtracting administrative claims. Fitch estimates the approximately $2.1 billion of unsecured claims recover approximately 45%, resulting in an RR of 'RR4'.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The new technology, which works with processors made by AMD as well as Intel, has more bandwidth while using less electricity than previous products, Andrew Feldman, formerly CEO of SeaMicro and now at AMD, told reporters at an event. AMD bought Silicon Valley startup SeaMicro in March for $334 million to gain a foothold in smaller, lower-power computer servers, a potential area of growth as Internet services expand and corporations look to save on electricity bills. Its focus on low-power servers comes as ARM Holdings , whose energy-efficient technology has become ubiquitous in smartphones and tablets, turns its attention to data centers, an area traditionally dominated by powerful “x86” chips made by AMD and Intel. AMD and Intel are both rushing to expand beyond their traditional PC market as consumers increasingly turn to tablets and smartphones. The rapid adoption of cloud computing - where data and applications are stored on or hosted on remote computers via the Internet - is driving worldwide server demand. AMD plans to market its chip technology along with SeaMicro’s platforms to its corporate partners: Hewlett Packard , Dell Inc and IBM. It has said the platforms consume a quarter of the power and take up a sixth of the space of the typical servers that make up the massive “farms” that corporations now maintain.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

AMD will expand its push into the still-new microserver market, combining ARM’s architecture typically used in smartphones with the x86 architecture common in PCs and servers, Chief Executive Officer Rory Read said on Monday. “AMD is the only computing company on the planet that’s introducing this ambidextrous architecture spanning both x86 and ARM ecosystems,” he told reporters at an event. One of Silicon Valley’s oldest chipmakers, AMD is losing money and struggling to redefine itself as consumers increasingly favor tablets over laptops and as manufacturers worried about the economy hold off on building new PCs. The company, which is a distant No. 2 to top chipmaker Intel Corp, announced this month it would slash 15 percent of its workforce, while devoting more resources to areas outside of its traditional PC business, including communications, industrial and gaming applications. AMD’s focus on microservers is a clear — albeit indirect — bet on the proliferation of smartphones, tablets and other personal computing devices. “The data center is where we fundamentally think the growth is going to be and where the innovation is going to be,” said Lisa Su, AMD’s senior vice president and general manager, global business units. BATTERY FRIENDLY Like Intel, Sunnyvale, California-based AMD was caught flat-footed in recent years with the emergence and fast growth of mobile devices like Apple’s iPad. Nearly all smartphones and tablets now use battery-friendly technology licensed by ARM to chipmakers like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics. AMD’s adoption of ARM’s technology comes as the British company turns toward data centers, where servers using its low-power technology are challenging the powerful Intel processors that currently power most servers. AMD also makes similar x86 server chips. When it comes to web surfing on tablets, or analyzing activities on Facebook in real time, data centers with many small, efficient processors are more efficient than those with a few large processors, said Patrick Moorhead, the head of Moor Insights & Strategy. “The new realm of servers is being driven by changes in client devices like smartphones and tablets,” Moorhead said. “What mega-data center builders are doing now is trying to find the most optimal architecture, and what they’re looking at very closely are microservers.” ARM has been working on its own 64-bit chip technology, a standard suited to data centers that takes better advantage of memory than its 32-bit chip technology used in smartphones and tablets. Intel and AMD already use 64-bit technology in their x86 server processors. AMD executives said they will focus on 64-bit server chips using ARM technology, with products expected in 2014. They said AMD may eventually use ARM’s technology for other kinds of chips as well. AMD has previously talked about plans to follow a strategy of adding other companies’ intellectual property to its future chip designs, mixing and matching different technologies to suit customers’ needs. Read, who left PC maker Lenovo last year to lead AMD, told analysts on a recent quarterly conference call that he had underestimated how quickly the PC industry was changing. He said AMD had to speed up its transformation. AMD expects its revenue to fall 10 percent in the current quarter compared with the September quarter. Reflecting the chipmaker’s troubles, AMD’s stock has fallen 59 percent over the past year. AMD took a step into the microserver market in March with the acquisition of Silicon Valley startup SeaMicro for $334 million, But it is not the only company to bet on microservers. Austin, Texas-based startup Calxeda is also focusing on ARM-based processors for data centers and Intel is working on low-powered versions of its x86 chips. Dell and Hewlett-Packard have also said they plan to sell ARM-based servers. With years of execution setbacks also weighing on AMD, the company is burning through cash, and industry analysts have recently become concerned about future liquidity. AMD’s cash declined $279 million in the third quarter to $1.48 billion. AMD said it was reducing its “optimal” cash target to $1.1 million from $1.5 billion due to the business’ now smaller size. In June, AMD announced it would add security technology designed by ARM to its processors, fueling speculation the two companies might be moving toward a deeper relationship.

The S&P 500 technology sector, which was at the heart of the recent selloff, provided the biggest boost to the benchmark S&P 500 index, which was on course for its third day of gains. Advanced Micro Devices Inc gained 14.7% after the chipmaker launched its second generation of processor chip and said that it had landed Alphabet Inc’s Google and Twitter Inc as customers. Symantec Corp jumped 11.6% after sources said chipmaker Broadcom Inc was in advanced talks to buy the cybersecurity company’s enterprise business. “The overnight action was positive. That, along with the bounceback yesterday, gave us a nice tailwind coming into the market today, both for high-frequency traders who were buying the trend and also for bargain hunters who had seen stocks that were on the watchlist come down to a level that looked attractive,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “So we’ve seen a lot of the tech names pop after they got hammered. There’s money coming back into those because investors have decided it created an opportunity.” U.S. data pointed to a robust labor market as the number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, allaying some worries about a recession and helping U.S. Treasury yields rise. That followed better-than-expected export numbers out of China and some improvement for the country’s yuan currency, whose slide over the weekend spurred Wall Street’s worst day so far this year on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 285.32 points, or 1.1%, to 26,292.39, the S&P 500 gained 45.67 points, or 1.58%, to 2,929.65 and the Nasdaq Composite added 154.78 points, or 1.97%, to 8,017.61. On the down side, Kraft Heinz sank after it pulled its full-year forecast and wrote down the value of several business units by over $1 billion, capping a rough few months for the company. Lyft Inc advanced 4.1% after the ride-hailing service raised its annual outlook and hinted at the end of its price war with Uber Technologies Inc. Uber, due to report after the bell and a high-profile loser since its market launch this year, rose 7.5%. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.32-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.52-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 38 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 77 new highs and 84 new lows.

Shares of technology companies, including Apple Inc and chipmakers, were higher before the bell. The iPhone maker’s shares rose 0.8%, while those of Intel Corp, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Nvidia Corp gained more than 1%. At 6:56 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 87 points, or 0.34%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 9.5 points, or 0.33% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 40.25 points, or 0.54%. With the second-quarter earnings season winding down, about three quarters of the 413 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far have topped earnings estimates. Match Group Inc jumped 18% after the online dating services provider forecast third-quarter sales above estimates, as its popular app Tinder attracted more users in the reported quarter. Walt Disney Co dropped 3.6% after its quarterly earnings missed analysts’ forecast as the company invested heavily in its streaming platform and began folding in assets purchased from Twenty-First Century Fox. Cambrex Corp soared 45% after the contract development and manufacturing company said it was being bought by an affiliate of private equity firm Permira Funds for about $2.02 billion.

AMD will expand its push into the still-new microserver market, combining ARM’s architecture typically used in smartphones with the x86 architecture common in PCs and servers, Chief Executive Officer Rory Read said on Monday. “AMD is the only computing company on the planet that’s introducing this ambidextrous architecture spanning both x86 and ARM ecosystems,” he told reporters at an event. One of Silicon Valley’s oldest chipmakers, AMD is losing money and struggling to redefine itself as consumers increasingly favor tablets over laptops and as manufacturers worried about the economy hold off on building new PCs. The company, which is a distant No. 2 to top chipmaker Intel Corp, announced this month it would slash 15 percent of its workforce, while devoting more resources to areas outside of its traditional PC business, including communications, industrial and gaming applications. AMD’s focus on microservers is a clear — albeit indirect — bet on the proliferation of smartphones, tablets and other personal computing devices. “The data center is where we fundamentally think the growth is going to be and where the innovation is going to be,” said Lisa Su, AMD’s senior vice president and general manager, global business units. BATTERY FRIENDLY Like Intel, Sunnyvale, California-based AMD was caught flat-footed in recent years with the emergence and fast growth of mobile devices like Apple’s iPad. Nearly all smartphones and tablets now use battery-friendly technology licensed by ARM to chipmakers like Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics. AMD’s adoption of ARM’s technology comes as the British company turns toward data centers, where servers using its low-power technology are challenging the powerful Intel processors that currently power most servers. AMD also makes similar x86 server chips. When it comes to web surfing on tablets, or analyzing activities on Facebook in real time, data centers with many small, low-power processors are more efficient than those with a few large processors, said Patrick Moorhead, the head of Moor Insights & Strategy. “The new realm of servers is being driven by changes in client devices like smartphones and tablets,” Moorhead said. “What mega-data center builders are doing now is trying to find the most optimal architecture, and what they’re looking at very closely are microservers.” ARM has been working on its own 64-bit chip technology, a standard suited to data centers that takes better advantage of memory than its 32-bit chip technology used in smartphones and tablets. Intel and AMD already use 64-bit technology in their x86 server processors. AMD executives said they will focus on 64-bit server chips using ARM technology, with products expected in 2014. They said AMD may eventually use ARM’s technology for other kinds of chips as well. AMD has previously talked about plans to follow a strategy of adding other companies’ intellectual property to its future chip designs, mixing and matching different technologies to suit customers’ needs. Read, who left PC maker Lenovo last year to lead AMD, told analysts on a recent quarterly conference call that he had underestimated how quickly the PC industry was changing. He said AMD must accelerate its shift toward designing embedded chips for fast-growing markets like game consoles and medical equipment. “Get the business balanced, simplify the portfolio, lower the cost base, then go after embedded (chips) . That’s in the tactical time frame,” Read told Reuters in an interview, asked about AMD’s strategy for the next few months. AMD expects its revenue to fall 10 percent in the current quarter compared with the September quarter. Reflecting the chipmaker’s troubles, AMD’s stock has fallen 59 percent over the past year. AMD took a step into the microserver market in March with the acquisition of Silicon Valley startup SeaMicro for $334 million, But it is not the only company to bet on microservers. Austin, Texas-based startup Calxeda is also focusing on ARM-based processors for data centers and Intel is working on low-powered versions of its x86 chips. Dell and Hewlett-Packard have also said they plan to sell ARM-based servers. With years of execution setbacks also weighing on AMD, the company is burning through cash, and industry analysts have recently become concerned about future liquidity. AMD’s cash declined $279 million in the third quarter to $1.48 billion. AMD said it was reducing its “optimal” cash target to $1.1 million from $1.5 billion due to the business’ now smaller size.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The Sunnyvale, California, company disappointed Wall Street on Tuesday with first fiscal quarter revenue and second-quarter revenue outlook that missed expectations due to a declining legacy business, sending its shares 4 percent lower after hours. But Applied Micro Circuits also announced it is shipping its new X-Gene “microserver” chips, made with intellectual property licensed from ARM Holdings, whose low-power technology is widely used in smartphones. In the quarter that ended in June, Applied Micro Circuits recognized its first revenue from the chips - about a $1 million - and the company said it expects “meaningful” revenue from the chips in the quarters ending in December and March as shipments build. “There is backlog today on the books for X-Gene, both in the September quarter and December quarter, as well as the March quarter,” Chief Executive Officer Paramesh Gopi told analysts on a conference call. While microservers have yet to be meaningfully adopted, proponents say data centers can be made more cost effective and energy efficient by using them instead of Intel’s brawny server chips. Intel dominates the server market and it stands to lose if server chips based on a rival architecture catch on, even if only a few percentage points of market share. “While we don’t take any competition lightly, the much-hyped threat of ARM servers getting any significant market segment share any time soon has been vastly overplayed,” said Intel spokesman Bill Calder. In January, Facebook Inc hardware guru Frank Frankovsky lauded low-power server technology and said he looked forward to greater choice of processors. Microservers at first will be most suited to data centers run by major Internet companies and for use in high-performance computing, proponents say.

Called “Project Shield”, the device - a cross between the controller familiar to most console gamers and a small tablet display - will be sold direct to consumers, an unusual move for a company best known for computer graphics cards and mobile processors. The unveiling late on Sunday took the industry by surprise. Nvidia offered few details beyond basic specifications. Executives said that when it launches, it will be able to run Google Android games now found on smartphones and tablets. It can also stream games from PCs. “Everything you do with your Android device just works here,” Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang told reporters in Las Vegas ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show. “This is the culmination of five years of work.” Nvidia is keeping a tight lid on Project Shield, with only a handful of closely guarded prototypes circulating within the company, a source at Nvidia told Reuters. Huang would not say when the device — or the Tegra 4 that powers it — will begin selling, or at what price. Tablets and smartphones support limited control functions like swiping and tapping. By integrating a controller with a screen, Nvidia may be angling for hardcore gamers who play shooter and other intense action games on consoles. Developers have not yet been successful in bringing such titles to mobile devices like the Apple iPad, analysts say. “At first glance, this does seem more primed for attacking the mobile and tablet consumer sector rather than impacting the Microsoft or Sony HD console experience,” said Jesse Divnich, an analyst at video game research firm EEDAR. Others said Nvidia may be trying to vie for a bigger slice of the console gaming market. Microsoft now uses graphics chips from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc for its Xbox, the market leader. Apart from a growing assortment of game-capable tablets and smartphones, Sony and Microsoft are both expected to release next-generation versions of the PlayStation and Xbox this year. Nvidia’s new device will support the popular game digital download service “Steam”, bringing on board top-selling titles like “Assassin’s Creed” and “Battlefield 3”. “Nvidia has really been a hardware consumer-facing company for nearly 15 years in the graphics card business,” PJ McNealy, CEO of Digital World Research, said. “It’ll be a challenge to leverage that legacy into a broader hardware business.” SHIELD Beyond gaming, entertainment features like Hulu and Netflix have become a unique selling point for Sony’s PlayStation and Microsoft’s Xbox consoles. “Nvidia is many years way from trying to penetrate that market,” Divnich said. With PC sales suffering due to economic uncertainty and a growing consumer preference for tablets, Nvidia has also staked its future on leveraging its graphics expertise to make high-performance processors for mobile devices. The Tegra 4 chip, with four central processing cores, will be Nvidia’s first to include LTE technology for high-speed telecommunication networks. The company has made inroads in tablets but competition from larger rival Qualcomm has some on Wall Street concerned the company may struggle to keep its mobile business growing fast. Qualcomm already offers 4G technology in its chips. Huang said Nvidia’s newest Tegra boasts improved image processing capabilities for digital cameras in phones and tablets. Huang also said the Tegra 4 chip lets tablets load web pages more quickly than devices using rival chips. The previous Tegra 3 is used in Google’s Nexus 7, one of only a handful of tablets to make inroads against Apple’s iPads. The Tegra 3 chip is also used in Microsoft’s recently launched Surface tablet. At the event, Huang also introduced a cloud product called the Nvidia Grid, a server and software package designed to remotely handle graphics computations for video games instead of on consoles like the Xbox in game-players’ living rooms. He said Nvidia would sell the Nvidia Grid packages to companies interested in hosting and streaming cloud-based video games.

JPMorgan Chase & Co rose 1.4 percent to $42.68 in premarket trading after reporting a 34 percent jump in third-quarter profits as the largest U.S. bank made more home mortgage loans. But Wells Fargo & Co lost 1.8 percent to $34.55 in premarket trading after reporting its third-quarter results. The earnings of both banks will be scrutinized for insight on the health of the financial sector and the economy as a whole. Both had been forecast to benefit significantly from a home loan refinancing boom. “The banks are a huge part of what is going on - they have been trading below tangible book value, which means people don’t believe what is on their books, so any time we get information on them, that could be a driver for the market,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. “So people are going to be analyzing the results from JP Morgan and trying to figure out if things in the economy are getting better or staying the same.” The benchmark S&P index has shed 1.9 percent so far this week, putting it on track for its worse weekly performance since a 3-percent drop in the week through June 3. Weak global demand has heightened investor worry over the corporate earnings season. As a group, S&P 500 companies’ third-quarter earnings are expected to fall 3 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data, marking the first decline in three years. Economic data is due, in the form of the September producer price index at 8:30 a.m. EDT (1230 GMT) and the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers preliminary consumer sentiment index for October at 9:55 a.m. (1355 ET). Producer prices are expected to show a 0.7 percent rise compared with a 1.7 percent rise in August. Economists in a Reuters survey expect a consumer sentiment reading of 78.0 compared with 78.3 in the final September report. Investors will eye the PPI data for any signs of inflation while consumer sentiment will be monitored for indications recent labor market data helped boost views on the economy. S&P 500 futures rose 3.7 points and were above fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures gained 24 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 3.5 points. Advanced Micro Devices Inc dropped 8.1 percent to $2.94 in premarket trading after the chipmaker said its third-quarter revenue likely fell 10 percent from the previous quarter as a weak global economy and a growing preference for tablets slams the PC industry. European shares fell and looked set to end the week in negative territory but analysts said the market was not likely to witness a sharp sell-off. Asian stocks steadied, but were on course for a losing week as worries about weak corporate earnings and slowing global economic growth limit the appeal of riskier assets.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

0,AMD,"January 8, 2013","                UPDATE 1-Nvidia previews own gaming device, shows off Tegra 4 - ReutersDiscover Thomson ReutersFinancialGovernment SolutionsLegalReuters News AgencyRisk Management SolutionsTax & AccountingBlog: Answers OnInnovation @ Thomson ReutersDirectory of sitesLoginContactSupportBusinessMarketsIndiaSouth AsiaTVMoreIndia Regulatory NewsJanuary 8, 2013 /  12:04 AM / 8 years agoUPDATE 1-Nvidia previews own gaming device, shows off Tegra 45 Min Read* “Project Shield” marks unusual foray into consumer devices * Attempts to bring hardcore gaming mobile * Details closely guarded for now By Noel Randewich LAS VEGAS, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Nvidia offered a sneak preview of a hand-held gaming device, powered by its latest “Tegra 4” processor, that it hopes will help it go up against Sony Corp, Microsoft Corp and other device makers in consumer gaming. Called “Project Shield”, the device - a cross between the controller familiar to most console gamers and a small tablet display - will be sold direct to consumers, an unusual move for a company best known for computer graphics cards and mobile processors. The unveiling late on Sunday took the industry by surprise. Nvidia offered few details beyond basic specifications. Executives said that when it launches, it will be able to run Google Android games now found on smartphones and tablets. It can also stream games from PCs. “Everything you do with your Android device just works here,” Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang told reporters in Las Vegas ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show. “This is the culmination of five years of work.” Nvidia is keeping a tight lid on Project Shield, with only a handful of closely guarded prototypes circulating within the company, a source at Nvidia told Reuters. Huang would not say when the device — or the Tegra 4 that powers it — will begin selling, or at what price. Tablets and smartphones support limited control functions like swiping and tapping. By integrating a controller with a screen, Nvidia may be angling for hardcore gamers who play shooter and other intense action games on consoles. Developers have not yet been successful in bringing such  titles to mobile devices like the Apple iPad, analysts say. “At first glance, this does seem more primed for attacking the mobile and tablet consumer sector rather than impacting the Microsft or Sony HD console experience,” said Jesse Divnich, an analyst at video game research firm EEDAR. Others said Nvidia may be trying to vie for a bigger slice of the console gaming market. Microsoft now uses graphics chips from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc for its Xbox, the market leader. Apart from a growing assortment of game-capable tablets and smartphones, Sony and Microsoft are both expected to release next-generation versions of the PlayStation and Xbox this year. Nvidia’s new device will support the popular game digital download service “Steam”, bringing on board top-selling titles like “Assassin’s Creed” and “Battlefield 3”. “Nvidia has really been a hardware consumer-facing company for nearly 15 years in the graphics card business,” PJ McNealy, CEO of Digital World Research, said. “It’ll be a challenge to leverage that legacy into a broader hardware business.” SHIELD Beyond gaming, entertainment features like Hulu and Netflix have become a unique selling point for Sony’s PlayStation and Microsoft’s Xbox consoles. “Nvidia is many years way from trying to penetrate that market,” Divnich said. With PC sales suffering due to economic uncertainty and a growing consumer preference for tablets, Nvidia has also staked its future on leveraging its graphics expertise to make high-performance processors for mobile devices. The Tegra 4 chip, with four central processing cores, will be Nvidia’s first to include LTE technology for high-speed telecommunication networks. The company has made inroads in tablets but competition from larger rival Qualcomm has some on Wall Street concerned the company may struggle to keep its mobile business growing fast. Qualcomm already offers 4G technology in its chips. Huang said Nvidia’s newest Tegra boasts improved image processing capabilities for digital cameras in phones and tablets. Huang also said the Tegra 4 chip lets tablets load web pages more quickly than devices using rival chips. The previous Tegra 3 is used in Google’s Nexus 7, one of only a handful of tablets to make inroads against Apple’s iPads. The Tegra 3 chip is also used in Microsoft’s  recently launched Surface tablet. At the event, Huang also introduced a cloud product called the Nvidia Grid, a server and software package designed to remotely handle graphics computations for video games instead of on consoles like the Xbox in game-players’ living rooms. He said Nvidia would sell the Nvidia Grid packages to companies interested in hosting and streaming cloud-based video games.Our Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

Stocks held gains following the release of minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting. Details of the meeting showed that policymakers were worried over the fate of currently low inflation and saw the recent tax changes as providing a boost to the economy. “It emphasizes the message they’ve had out there, that they’ll be data dependent and that they want to try to normalize policy unless there’s an economic slowdown or inflation doesn’t act as expected,” said Sameer Samana, global equity and technical strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. “It was at least interesting that they tipped their hats to the tax cuts.” Earlier in the session, a report showed U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, in a further sign of strong economic momentum at the end of 2017. Meanwhile, manufacturing surveys pointed to a strong start for the European economy. The technology sector was boosted by a rise in shares of Alphabet, IBM and chipmakers. The S&P 500 tech index - the best-performing S&P 500 sector in 2017 with a 37-percent jump - was up 1 percent. U.S. chipmaker stocks surged for second straight session, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index up 1.4 percent and heading for its strongest two-day performance since July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 48.67 points, or 0.2 percent, to 24,872.68, the S&P 500 gained 13.73 points, or 0.51 percent, to 2,709.54 and the Nasdaq Composite added 52.86 points, or 0.75 percent, to 7,059.75. Oracle shares were up 2.5 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock. Gains in energy and healthcare also boosted the market. The S&P energy index was up 1.5 percent while S&P healthcare was up 1 percent. Intel fell 6.2 percent following a report that its processor chips had a fundamental design flaw. Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices climbed 9.5 percent. Nvidia gained 6.6 percent and Micron rose 2.8 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.31-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

All three major stock indexes closed at all-time highs on Monday, continuing a record-setting spree. President Donald Trump further fanned hopes of a trade truce over the weekend by saying the two sides would sign a Phase 1 deal “very shortly.” Investors were wary at the beginning of the month about the stock market mirroring a slump from December 2018, when trade tensions between the world’s top two economies escalated, marking the worst December on Wall Street since the Great Depression. But the much-awaited breakthrough in negotiations, coupled with indications of a smoother exit for Britain from the European Union, has sent financial markets across the world into record territory this month. “This holiday period should be rather calm as trade updates appear very constructive as we near the finalization of the Phase 1 trade deal next month,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, wrote in a note. The S&P 500 is up nearly 29% so far in 2019 and set for its best year since 2013, also powered by three interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and easing fears of a recession. At 8:45 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 26 points, or 0.09%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 1.5 points, or 0.05% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 6 points, or 0.07%. Volumes are expected to be thin this week as traders settle in for the holidays, with the main U.S. stock exchanges to close at 1 p.m. ET on Tuesday and remain shut on Christmas Day. Among the few individual movers premarket, Advanced Micro Devices Inc rose 1.5% after RBC Capital Markets raised it price target on the chipmaker’s shares on improving data center demand. Boeing Co was indicated slightly higher, a day after the beleaguered planemaker ousted Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg as it grapples with the crisis around its grounded 737 MAX jets.

Stocks added slightly to gains late, with some support from minutes from the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting showing the U.S. central bank would likely stick to gradual interest rate hikes this year. “They reiterated gradual rate increases, so that’s steady as she goes, which the stock market seems to like,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.  Earlier in the session, data showed U.S. factory activity increased more than expected in December, a sign of economic momentum at the end of 2017. Meanwhile, manufacturing surveys pointed to a strong start for the European economy. For technology stocks, Alphabet Inc, IBM and chipmakers were among the biggest drivers. The S&P 500 tech index, the best-performing S&P sector in 2017 with a 37 percent jump, ended the day up 1.1 percent. U.S. chipmaker stocks surged for a second straight session, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor index up 1.7 percent in its strongest two-day performance since June 2016. “The (recent) selloff in tech stocks may have made that group look attractive today given that there’s still significant growth potential there both short term and long term,” Hellwig said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 98.67 points, or 0.4 percent, to 24,922.68, the S&P 500 gained 17.25 points, or 0.64 percent, to 2,713.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 58.63 points, or 0.84 percent, to 7,065.53. The Cboe Volatility Index, better known as the VIX and a popular options-based gauge of expected near-term price volatility, closed at 9.15, just shy of its record low close of 9.14 on Nov. 3. Gains in energy and healthcare also boosted the market. The S&P energy index gained 1.5 percent while S&P healthcare rose 1 percent. Intel Corp ended down 3.4 percent. The company acknowledged a report that a design flaw in its chips could let hackers steal data but said it was working on a solution that would not significantly slow computers. Rival chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices climbed 5.2 percent. Nvidia Corp gained 6.6 percent and Micron Technology Inc rose 3 percent.

At the end of its two-day policy meeting the Fed said it maintained its interest rate target range until it is confident the economy has weathered the virus and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. “This was pretty much as expected. The key statement will be in September when they give some forward guidance,” said Stan Shipley, Evercore ISI macro research analyst in New York. Wall Street’s major indexes were already higher before the Fed commentary, on the eve of scheduled earnings reports from Amazon.com Inc, Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Alphabet’s Google. The chief executives of all four companies also faced a congressional hearing on antitrust issues. “You’ll often see an uptick in those shares ahead of earnings and if they disappoint then they tend to sell off,” said Shawn Snyder, head of investment strategy at Citi Personal Wealth Management. At 2:30 p.m. ET (1830 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 105.68 points, or 0.4%, to 26,484.96, the S&P 500 gained 32.98 points, or 1.02%, to 3,251.42 and the Nasdaq Composite added 124.98 points, or 1.2%, to 10,527.07. All 11 major S&P sectors were higher with financial and technology stocks leading the percentage gainers. Investors were also focused on contentious negotiations in Washington around what should go into government’s next coronavirus relief plan days before enhanced unemployment benefits were set to expire. On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he did not support everything in a Senate Republican proposal but would not elaborate. Advanced Micro Devices Inc shares were up 12.6% after the chipmaker raised its full-year revenue forecast and the Philadelphia chip index rose 2%. Starbucks Corp climbed 4% after the coffee chain said business was “steadily recovering” worldwide and it would report a profit in the current quarter. Of the S&P 500 firms that have reported results, 79.1% have surpassed a low bar of quarterly profit expectations, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Recent data pointed to a possible slowdown in business and hiring as several U.S. states reimposed restrictions after a spike in COVID-19 infections, while deaths in the country caused by the disease surpassed 150,000 on Wednesday. Boeing Co slipped 2.6% as it slashed production on its widebody programs and reported a bigger-than-expected loss due to the fallout from the pandemic. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.18-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.92-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 37 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 73 new highs and 14 new lows.

The AWS Graviton2 processor, which is estimated to be seven times faster than its previous chip, uses technology from SoftBank Group Corp-owned (9984.T) Arm Holdings.  Reuters reported last week that Amazon was looking to design a data center processor chip to power its cloud unit. Data center processor chips are used in cloud computing, an area that is fast emerging as a big business.  With the new chip, Amazon is looking to reduce its reliance on processors made by Intel and AMD to power its money-spinning cloud business, AWS.

Several companies warned of disruption to their operations due to the virus outbreak, while a Chinese government economist was also quoted as saying the country’s economic growth may drop to 5% or even lower. Starbucks Corp dropped 2.9% after warning of a financial hit as it closed thousands of restaurants and adjusted operating hours in China. American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines Holdings Inc said they were canceling some flights to China, while Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd said its 2020 earnings would be hurt after it canceled three trips of its China-based cruise liner. “The market remains a bit uneasy about the situation in China,” said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. “There’s still a feeling that as good as things have been up till now, you could see problems in China lead to a slowing in the next quarter.” The indexes opened up about 0.4%, but the gains quickly evaporated as shares in AT&T, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Anthem Inc fell following their results. Apple Inc, however, gained 2.3% after reporting earnings for the holiday shopping quarter above analysts’ expectations, even as it braced for more supply disruptions in virus-hit China. Boeing Co jumped 2.4% after the planemaker’s forecast of nearly $19 billion in costs related to the grounding of its 737 MAX jets was smaller than analysts’ expectations. At 10:32 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.31%, at 28,811.23. The S&P 500 rose 0.11%, at 3,279.91 and the Nasdaq Composite gained just 0.06%, at 9,275.54. Investors were also on the sidelines ahead of the Federal Reserve’s statement later in the day from its policy meeting. Interest rates will almost certainly remain on hold. Advanced Micro Devices Inc dropped 7% after the chipmaker forecast first-quarter revenue largely below analysts’ estimates due to waning demand from gaming console makers. AT&T Inc fell 2.4% after it missed fourth-quarter revenue estimates, while Anthem Inc dropped 5.6% after the health insurer missed estimates for medical costs in the fourth quarter. General Electric jumped 10% after the industrial conglomerate reported quarterly profit and cash flow that exceeded analysts’ estimates, boosted by its aviation unit. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.26-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.14-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 25 new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 54 new highs and 32 new lows.

Several companies warned of disruption to their operations due to the virus outbreak, while a Chinese government economist was also quoted as saying the country’s economic growth may drop to 5% or even lower. Starbucks Corp dropped 2.9% after warning of a financial hit as it closed thousands of restaurants and adjusted operating hours in China. American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines Holdings Inc said they were canceling some flights to China, while Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd said its 2020 earnings would be hurt after it canceled three trips of its China-based cruise liner. “The market remains a bit uneasy about the situation in China,” said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. “There’s still a feeling that as good as things have been up till now, you could see problems in China lead to a slowing in the next quarter.” The indexes opened up about 0.4%, but the gains quickly evaporated as shares in AT&T, Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Anthem Inc fell following their results. Apple Inc, however, gained 2.3% after reporting earnings for the holiday shopping quarter above analysts’ expectations, even as it braced for more supply disruptions in virus-hit China. Boeing Co jumped 2.4% after the planemaker’s forecast of nearly $19 billion in costs related to the grounding of its 737 MAX jets was smaller than analysts’ expectations. At 10:32 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.31%, at 28,811.23. The S&P 500 rose 0.11%, at 3,279.91 and the Nasdaq Composite gained just 0.06%, at 9,275.54. Investors were also on the sidelines ahead of the Federal Reserve’s statement later in the day from its policy meeting. Interest rates will almost certainly remain on hold. Advanced Micro Devices Inc dropped 7% after the chipmaker forecast first-quarter revenue largely below analysts’ estimates due to waning demand from gaming console makers. AT&T Inc fell 2.4% after it missed fourth-quarter revenue estimates, while Anthem Inc dropped 5.6% after the health insurer missed estimates for medical costs in the fourth quarter. General Electric jumped 10% after the industrial conglomerate reported quarterly profit and cash flow that exceeded analysts’ estimates, boosted by its aviation unit. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.26-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.14-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 25 new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 54 new highs and 32 new lows.

Advanced Micro Devices Inc jumped 12% after the chipmaker raised its full-year revenue forecast. AMD shares were among the top boosts to the benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. The Philadelphia chip index rose 1.1%. Starbucks Corp climbed 4% after the coffee chain said business was “steadily recovering” worldwide and it would return to profitability in the current quarter. Of the 163 S&P 500 firms that have reported results, 79.1% have surpassed a low bar of quarterly profit expectations, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Recent data pointed to a possible slowdown in business and hiring as infections spiked in southern and western U.S. states, and deaths from the novel coronavirus approached 150,000 in the country on Wednesday. Investors will keep a close watch on how the U.S. central bank addresses these economic risks at the end of a two-day policy meeting. The Fed’s statement is expected at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), which will be followed by Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. Emergency monetary stimulus measures along with trillions of dollars in fiscal support have been pivotal in driving a sharp recovery in the U.S. stock markets since March. “The biggest catalyst within the market right now — for at least the bullish sentiment — is where’s the next wave of liquidity,” said Andrew Smith, chief investment strategist, Delos Capital Advisors, based in Dallas. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday his administration and Democrats in Congress were far apart in their efforts to come together on a coronavirus relief bill, and he suggested he was not in a hurry to strike a deal.

Nvidia Corp jumped 6.4% in premarket trading as it forecast first-quarter revenue that topped analysts’ expectations, reinforcing expectations of a rebound in chip demand. Shares of rival Intel Corp rose 0.6%, while Advanced Micro Devices Inc gained 1.6%. Wall Street is on course for a second straight weekly rise after hitting a series of record highs as a largely positive fourth-quarter earnings season and confidence in the U.S. economy helped investors look past conflicting headlines on the virus. A recent Reuters poll showed the virus-hit Chinese economy will grow at its slowest rate since the financial crisis in the current quarter but the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained.

Wall Street’s main indexes had closed more than 4% higher on Monday after their worst week since 2008, as central banks in Japan and the European Union joined the Federal Reserve in signaling further monetary easing. But a statement from the meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors on Tuesday only said they stood “ready to take actions, including fiscal measures where appropriate”. “The G7 is essentially trying to reassure markets but it doesn’t have the ability to really impact interest rates directly,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. As of Monday, traders had fully priced in a 50 basis point reduction in borrowing costs from the Fed this month, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, compared with zero just a week ago, as the virus spreads faster outside China. “Frankly, futures are overestimating not just the probability of a cut, but the magnitude of the cut as well,” Frederick said. At 8:51 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 102 points, or 0.39%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 7.5 points, or 0.24% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 50.25 points, or 0.57%. Although futures were trading higher just before the bell, the implied open for Wall Street’s main stock indexes was lower. Healthcare equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific, rose 5% in premarket trading after it launched a $11.6 billion bid for German genetic testing company Qiagen. Department store retailer Kohl’s Corp gained 4.1% after it beat quarterly profit estimates as partnerships with online retail giant Amazon.com and others brought in more shoppers to its stores. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices rose 2.4% after Piper Sandler raised the stock to “overweight” on expectations the company would continue to gain market share from peer Intel over the next several years. Electric-car maker Tesla rose 6.7% after brokerage JMP Securities upgraded the stock to “market perform”. Focus will also be on U.S. politics as 14 states hold primaries on Super Tuesday to choose the Democratic candidate to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 elections.

General Motors Co rose 4.6% premarket after posting a smaller-than-expected loss for the second quarter, helped by pickup truck sales and aggressive cost-cutting. Advanced Micro Devices Inc jumped 11% after the chipmaker raised its full-year revenue forecast, driven in part by an overall surge in chip demand and market-share gains from larger rival Intel Corp. Of the 163 S&P 500 firms that have reported results, 79.1% have surpassed a low bar of quarterly profit expectations, according to Refinitiv IBES data, well above the average of 59% of companies beating profit estimates over the past four quarters.

Chipmakers, which are sensitive to China’s growth, were under pressure, with Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc dropping about 1% each in premarket trade. President Donald Trump has promised action over China’s new national security legislation for Hong Kong by the end of the week. Analysts have warned the souring relations between the world’s two largest economies in recent weeks over trade and the handling of the coronavirus outbreak pose the biggest threat to the stock market’s strong rally off the March lows. The benchmark S&P 500 hit a near three-month high on Wednesday, closing above the key psychological level of 3,000 amid growing evidence of a pick up in business activity. Investors will also focus on Labor Department’s data which is expected to show that more than 2 million Americans sought unemployment benefits for the 10th straight week. The report is due at 8:30 a.m. ET. At 6:20 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 69 points, or 0.27% and S&P 500 e-minis were down 3 points, or 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 54.5 points, or 0.58%. Micron Technology Inc dropped 1.1% despite raising its revenue forecast for the third quarter. In a bright spot, Boeing Co climbed 4.2%, the most among the 25 Dow components trading before the bell, after the planemaker said it had resumed production of its 737 MAX passenger jet at its Washington plant.

REUTERS/ Mike Blake(Reuters) - Semiconductor firm Nvidia Corp on Thursday announced a new chip that can be digitally split up to run several different programs on one physical chip, a first for the company that matches a key capability on many of Intel Corp’s chips. The notion behind what the Santa Clara, California-based company calls its A100 chip is simple: Help the owners of data centers get every bit of computing power possible out of the physical chips they purchase by ensuring the chip never sits idle. The same principle helped power the rise of cloud computing over the past two decades and helped Intel build a massive data center business. When software developers turn to a cloud computing provider such as Amazon.com or Microsoft Corp for computing power, they do not rent a full physical server inside a data center. Instead they rent a software-based slice of a physical server called a “virtual machine.” Such virtualization technology came about because software developers realized that powerful and pricey servers often ran far below full computing capacity. By slicing physical machines into smaller virtual ones, developers could cram more software on to them, similar to the puzzle game Tetris. Amazon, Microsoft and others built profitable cloud businesses out of wringing every bit of computing power from their hardware and selling that power to millions of customers.  But the technology has been mostly limited to processor chips from Intel and similar chips such as those from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Nvidia said Thursday that its new A100 chip can be split into seven “instances.” For Nvida, that solves a practical problem. Nvidia sells chips for artificial intelligence tasks. The market for those chips breaks into two parts. “Training” requires a powerful chip to, for example, analyze millions of images to train an algorithm to recognize faces. But once the algorithm is trained, “inference” tasks need only a fraction of the computing power to scan a single image and spot a face. Nvidia is hoping the A100 can replace both, being used as a big single chip for training and split into smaller inference chips.  Customers who want to test the theory will pay a steep price of $200,000 for Nvidia’s DGX server built around the A100 chips. In a call with reporters, Chief Executive Jensen Huang argued the math will work in Nvidia’s favor, saying the computing power in the DGX A100 was equal to that of 75 traditional servers that would cost $5,000 each.   “Because it’s fungible, you don’t have to buy all these different types of servers. Utilization will be higher,” he said. “You’ve got 75 times the performance of a $5,000 server, and you don’t have to buy all the cables.” Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Leslie AdlerOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

FILE PHOTO: A rendered image of the NVIDIA Orin chip, which is used for a new platform the company launched on Thursday that can support everything from safety driving technology all the way to self-driving technology for robotaxis, is seen in this undated handout image released to Reuters on May 13, 2020. NVINDIA/Handout via REUTERSThe move, announced as part of the chip company’s annual conference, which was held online this year, represents a change in direction for Nvidia. Until now, the Santa Clara, California-based company has supplied key technology aimed at making autonomous vehicles that require much more sophisticated computers.  But such vehicles, some of which are known as “robo-taxis,” remain years away from mass adoption. Even before the coronavirus pandemic hammered the world economy, automakers such as General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co were dialing down their expectations for self-driving cars. Many of the driver-assistance features that the new Nvidia system will enable, by contrast, are already available on high-end vehicles with technology from providers such as Mobileye, the Israeli firm owned by Nvidia data center rival Intel Corp. Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at Nvidia, said the shift in strategy is aimed at meeting the existing needs of automakers that struggle with maintaining two systems - one for the driver assistance available today, and one for more advanced self-driving technology for the future.     The new Nvidia system means automakers will be able to use one system for both, saving engineering efforts and using some of the self-driving technology to improve the driver assistance functions, Shapiro said. “We have a single architecture that will enable the automaker to span every potential level of automation they want to deliver and put that software-updatable system in every single vehicle,” Shapiro said. Nvidia’s new self-driving technology uses the “Orin” processing chip the company launched in December. Shapiro said he expected vehicles using the system could start production in early 2023.  Shapiro declined to comment on pricing or potential automaker customers. However, he said the Nvidia chips will be part of a larger system that includes cameras and will likely be built by traditional automotive suppliers such as Continental AG, ZF Friedrichshafen AG or Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL].   “We’re the (artificial intelligence) brain that would go into this,” Shapiro said.

REUTERS/Mike Blake(Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia Corp on Tuesday opened up for membership its cloud-based game streaming service GeForce NOW, taking on Google’s Stadia in a market that is primed for high growth over the next few years.  The platform virtually uses a GeForce graphics card to power personal computers, android phones and Shield TVs, enabling the devices to run games with enhanced graphics.  GeForce NOW, previously available on a public beta version, will offer a Founders version at $4.99 per month alongside a free tier. Google Stadia offers a 4K version as part of its premium service priced at $9.99 per month, while the free high-definition version is expected to roll out this year.    Stadia has been downloaded nearly 593,000 times since its launch in November, according to data from industry site Sensor Tower. GeForce NOW will also compete with Microsoft Corp’s Project xCloud, which is likely to be launched this year. The cloud gaming market is expected to expand to $8 billion by 2025 from $1 billion in 2018, according to data from Statista. Analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights & Strategy expects the cloud gaming market to grow exponentially over the next five years as giants like Alphabet Inc’s Google, Microsoft and Nvidia enter the market with acceptable experiences. GeForce NOW has over 30 free-to-play games and users can also add games previously owned, while Stadia’s premium version  launched with a slate of 22 games.    Users who opt for Nvidia’s Founders version will have access to games which support ray tracing, or the ability to simulate how light rays will bounce around in a visual scene, making the visuals more realistic.

FILE PHOTO: A rendered image of the NVIDIA Orin chip, which is used for a new platform the company launched on Thursday that can support everything from safety driving technology all the way to self-driving technology for robotaxis, is seen in this undated handout image released to Reuters on May 13, 2020. NVINDIA/Handout via REUTERSThe move, announced as part of the chip company’s annual conference, which was held online this year, represents a change in direction for Nvidia. Until now, the Santa Clara, California-based company has supplied key technology aimed at making autonomous vehicles that require much more sophisticated computers.  But such vehicles, some of which are known as “robo-taxis,” remain years away from mass adoption. Even before the coronavirus pandemic hammered the world economy, automakers such as General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co were dialing down their expectations for self-driving cars. Many of the driver-assistance features that the new Nvidia system will enable, by contrast, are already available on high-end vehicles with technology from providers such as Mobileye, the Israeli firm owned by Nvidia data center rival Intel Corp. Danny Shapiro, senior director of automotive at Nvidia, said the shift in strategy is aimed at meeting the existing needs of automakers that struggle with maintaining two systems - one for the driver assistance available today, and one for more advanced self-driving technology for the future.     The new Nvidia system means automakers will be able to use one system for both, saving engineering efforts and using some of the self-driving technology to improve the driver assistance functions, Shapiro said. “We have a single architecture that will enable the automaker to span every potential level of automation they want to deliver and put that software-updatable system in every single vehicle,” Shapiro said. Nvidia’s new self-driving technology uses the “Orin” processing chip the company launched in December. Shapiro said he expected vehicles using the system could start production in early 2023.  Shapiro declined to comment on pricing or potential automaker customers. However, he said the Nvidia chips will be part of a larger system that includes cameras and will likely be built by traditional automotive suppliers such as Continental AG, ZF Friedrichshafen AG or Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL].   “We’re the (artificial intelligence) brain that would go into this,” Shapiro said.

Mellanox shares rose nearly 2% in afternoon trading, while Nvidia jumped about 4%. Many acquisitions between U.S. and international companies with significant operations in China have faced challenges in securing approval from the country’s regulator due to a bitter trade war between the two largest economies of the world that started in January, 2018.  Two years ago, U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc had to walk away from a $44 billion deal to buy NXP Semiconductors after failing to secure Chinese regulatory approval. Nvidia, known for its powerful gaming graphics chips, wants to bolster its data center and artificial intelligence business through the Mellanox takeover, its biggest deal, to better compete with rival Intel. U.S. and EU antitrust authorities have already given their approval for the deal, which is expected to close before April 27, 2020.

REUTERS/Mike Blake(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp said on Wednesday its chips used to power artificial intelligence topped a series of benchmark tests that measure a key performance metric in the industry.  The results are a boost to the company’s efforts to make headway into one of the biggest growth areas in the field called  inference, which is the process of using an AI algorithm for tasks such as translating audio into text-based requests. Intel Corp’s processors currently dominate the market for machine learning inference, which analysts at Morningstar estimate to be worth $11.8 billion by 2021.      However, Nvidia dominates the AI training chip market, where huge amounts of data help algorithms “learn” a task such as how to recognize a human voice.  The company said its inference chips have now achieved the fastest results on five new independent suite of AI benchmarks, called MLPerf Inference 0.5. The company on Wednesday also unveiled Jetson Xavier NX, a new chip designed for AI computer, which is the size of a credit card. The chip can be used in devices, including small commercial robots, drones and portable medical devices, that require more computing power without sacrificing size or weight, Nvidia said.

REUTERS/Mike Blake(Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp's chip company Arm Holdings Ltd has gathered takeover interest from Nvidia Corp, Bloomberg News reported bloom.bg/30R4Kh5 on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Nvidia and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while Arm declined to comment on the report. SoftBank, which acquired Arm for $32 billion in 2016, is exploring options including a full or partial sale or a public offering of the British chip designer, the Wall Street Journal reported last week. The Japanese conglomerate had recently approached Apple Inc to gauge its interest but the latter is not planning to pursue a bid, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Arm’s licensing operation would fit poorly with Apple’s hardware and software focused business model and there may also be regulatory concerns about Apple owning a key licensee that supplies so many rivals, according to the report. Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment. SoftBank last month unveiled a series of transactions to divest more than $21 billion worth of stock in U.S. wireless carrier T-Mobile US Inc, as it seeks funding for a $41 billion share buyback and debt reduction plan.

The EU competition enforcer is scheduled to decide on Nvidia’s biggest-ever acquisition by Dec. 19. It is not clear if the deal will be cleared unconditionally or will face a full-scale investigation. Nvidia, known for its powerful gaming graphics chips, declined to comment. Thursday was the last day to offer concessions, if these were required to address any EU antitrust concerns. The company outbid rival Intel Corp (INTC.O) for Mellanox in a move aimed at boosting its data center and artificial intelligence business. Its chips connect data centers into one giant computer.

FILE PHOTO: A NVIDIA logo is shown at SIGGRAPH 2017 in Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 31, 2017.  REUTERS/Mike BlakeIn a semiconductor industry milestone, Nvidia’s shares rose 2.3% in afternoon trading on Wednesday to a record $404, putting the graphic component maker’s market capitalization at $248 billion, just above the $246 billion value of Intel, once the world’s leading chipmaker. For a graphic on Nvidia’s stock market value eclipses Intel: here Nvidia’s stock has been among Wall Street’s strongest performers in recent years as it expanded from its core personal computer chip business into datacenters, automobiles and artificial intelligence. Intel, which for decades has dominated in processors for PCs and servers, has struggled to diversify its business after making critical stumbles in the smartphone revolution.  U.S. chipmakers have mostly outperformed since the S&P 500 hit a low on March 23, but Intel has enjoyed much less of that rebound than Nvidia, which is frequently among the most traded stocks on Fidelity and other retail investing websites.  While Intel’s stock has lost almost 3% in 2020, Nvidia’s has surged 68%. Investors have been betting that the shift to working remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic will continue to fuel fast growth in Nvidia’s datacenter business. In recent years, Intel has also faced greater competition from foreign competitors, and its market capitalization has already fallen below those of South Korea’s Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW).  Most recently, Intel has suffered setbacks in its sprawling supply chain due to the pandemic, and higher costs related to the development of upcoming “Tiger Lake” 10-nanometer processors. Despite Nvidia’s meteoric stock rise, its sales remain a fraction of Intel’s. Analysts on average see Nvidia’s revenue rising 34% in its current fiscal year to $14.6 billion, while analysts expect Intel’s 2020 revenue to increase 2.5% to $73.8 billion, according to Refinitiv. Reflecting investors’ optimism about Nvidia’s future profit growth, Nvidia’s shares are currently trading at 45 times expected earnings, while Intel’s trade at 12 times expected earnings.

Nvidia got its start with chips to make computer games more realistic, but in recent years has shifted to supplying chips that speed up artificial intelligence tasks, such as teaching computers to recognize images. Once the domain of Silicon Valley tech firms, artificial intelligence technology is filtering to mainstream businesses that use it for tasks like seeking unseen patterns in their financials to help with forecasting and cost controls. Many of those mainstream businesses use software made by VMware to help shuffle computing work back and forth between their own data centers and cloud data centers owned by Amazon Web Services, depending on where the cost is best. But that has been difficult to do with computer programs that rely on Nvidia chips for a speed boost.                    On Monday, the companies said Nvidia intends to release a new piece of software called vComputeServer to address the issue and let their joint customers move Nvida-aided computing work around more easily.

REUTERS/Matthew Tostevin(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Monday it will use chipmaker Nvidia Corp’s (NVDA.O) real-time ray tracing technology to provide the software company’s Minecraft video game players more realistic graphics on personal computers. Real-time ray tracing, or the ability for the chip to simulate how light rays will bounce around in a visual scene, helps video games and other computer graphics more closely resemble shadows and reflections in the real world. Last week, Nvidia posted quarterly results ahead of Wall Street targets and said its profitability was getting a boost from new high-end graphics chips for video gamers. “I think we’ve put all of the pieces in place to bring ray tracing into the future of games. The number of blockbuster games that have adopted RTX is really snowballing,” Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jen-Hsun Huang said on a post-earnings call. Other games which would have the same graphic technology are Activision Blizzard’s (ATVI.O) “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare”, Ubisoft Toronto’s “Watch Dogs: Legion” and Tencent NExT Studios’ “Synced: Off Planet”, Nvidia said on Monday. Minecraft, a construction game in which players can build nearly anything imaginable, block by block, in a digital, Lego-like world, spread like wildfire since its full release in 2011 by developer Mojang, which was bought by Microsoft in 2014. In May this year, Microsoft said 176 million versions of the game have been sold since its launch.

Other games which would have the same graphic technology are Activision Blizzard’s (ATVI.O) “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare”, Ubisoft Toronto’s “Watch Dogs: Legion” and Tencent NExT Studios’ “Synced: Off Planet”, Nvidia said on Monday. Minecraft, a construction game in which players can build nearly anything imaginable, block by block, in a digital, Lego-like world, spread like wildfire since its full release in 2011 by developer Mojang, which was bought by Microsoft in 2014. In May this year, Microsoft said 176 million versions of the game have been sold since its launch.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of Nvidia Corporation is seen during the annual Computex computer exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan May 30, 2017. REUTERS/Tyrone SiuRevenue fell 17% in the fiscal second quarter ended July 28 and net income fell by half from a year earlier, but results improved from the previous three months. Chief Executive Jensen Huang said gaming laptops able to handle sophisticated games and artificial intelligence models able to handle real-time chat bots were driving demand. The new video game chips use so-called ray tracing technology, which creates pictures by calculating how light hits objects, and students returning to school are buying laptops with the high-end silicon. “Essentially our business is normalized,” Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said, forecasting improving profit margins due to sales of the high-end gaming chips. The previous fiscal year set a sales record but came to what Huang at the time called a “disappointing finish” due to a slowdown in China and a bust in the market for crypto mining chips. The results come against the backdrop of a slowing industry, with research firm Gartner forecasting a 9.6% drop in global semiconductor revenue in 2019. U.S.-China trade tensions, including tariffs on some products, are pressuring chipmakers. The graphics chip maker also said it would resume share buybacks after completing the acquisition of networking products maker Mellanox this year. Nvidia is known for its graphics chips that power video games, but it has developed other markets including artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and data centres. Total revenue in the second quarter fell 17% to $2.58 billion but topped Wall Street targets of $2.55 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue was up 16% from the previous quarter. Revenue in the video gaming business fell 27% to $1.31 billion and beat analysts’ estimate of $1.28 billion, based on an average of five analysts. Sales at the automotive unit rose 30% to $209 million in the quarter. Analysts expected $175 million.  Data centre revenue, which has been an area of concern, fell 14% to $655 million, just behind the $671 million consensus. The company said it expects third-quarter revenue of $2.9 billion, plus or minus 2%. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $2.97 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The third-quarter revenue outlook set on Thursday was a touch behind expectations, but “somewhat better than feared in the current macro environment” analyst Kinngai Chan of Summit Insights Group said in an email. Quarter-on-quarter growth in gaming and autos gave investors some comfort about the medium to long term, Chan said. It reported second-quarter adjusted gross margin of 60.1%, above expectations of 59.5%. It forecast third-quarter margin of 62.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points, versus expectations of 60.4%, according to IBES.  Nvidia’s net income fell 50% to $552 million, or 90 cents per share, in the fiscal second-quarter. Excluding items, it earned $1.24 per share, ahead of expectations of $1.15.

Nvidia Corp jumped 8% as the company forecast first-quarter revenue ahead of analysts’ estimates, reinforcing expectations of a rebound in chip demand. Its shares lifted the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index by 0.3%, while the broader technology rose 0.5%. Meanwhile, the coronavirus epidemic in China showed no signs of easing, with health authorities reporting on Friday more than 5,000 new cases. A recent Reuters poll showed the world’s second-biggest economy will grow at its slowest pace since the financial crisis in the current quarter but the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained. “This seems to be a teflon market, where any negativity - whether it is coronavirus or anything - for now continues to get shrugged off,” said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. Economic data continues to be good enough to sustain the market’s uptrend, he added. Wall Street was on course for a second straight weekly gain after hitting a series of record highs on a largely positive fourth-quarter earnings season and confidence in the U.S. economy. However, data released on Friday was not so rosy. A Commerce Department retail sales report showed consumer spending likely slowed further in January, while separate data indicated industrial production fell more than expected last month. At 11:44 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.36 points, or 0.01%, at 29,420.95. The S&P 500 was up 4.78 points, or 0.14%, at 3,378.72 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 25.48 points, or 0.26%, at 9,737.45. The fourth-quarter earnings season is approaching the final lap. About 71% of the 378 S&P 500 firms that have reported so far have topped earnings estimates, according to IBES by Refinitiv. Expedia Inc jumped 11.3% after the online travel services company forecast strong quarterly core earnings amid coronavirus uncertainties. The energy, healthcare and industrial sectors were the losers among the 11 major S&P sectors. U.S. financial markets are closed on Monday for President’s Day. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.17-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 1.02-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 59 new 52-week highs and two new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 110 new highs and 41 new lows.

Adding to the downbeat sentiment were a Commerce Department retail sales report showing consumer spending likely slowed further in January and data indicating industrial production fell more than expected last month. Meanwhile, the coronavirus epidemic in China showed no signs of easing, with health authorities reporting more than 5,000 new cases on Friday. A recent Reuters poll showed the world’s second-biggest economy will grow at its slowest pace since the financial crisis in the current quarter but the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained. “Investors are definitely keeping an eye on how much the coronavirus is spreading and where it spreads to. It still remains the biggest risk going forward,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. “Earnings from last night are definitely helping the sentiment but it’s still too early to tell how the day will go.” Wall Street is on course for a second straight weekly gain after hitting a series of record highs, as a largely positive fourth-quarter earnings season and confidence in the U.S. economy helped investors look past conflicting headlines on the virus outbreak. Nvidia Corp jumped 6.5% as it forecast first-quarter revenue that topped analysts’ estimates, reinforcing expectations of a rebound in chip demand. Its shares lifted the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index by 0.6%, while the broader technology rose 0.1%. At 9:59 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.08% to 29,398.59. The S&P 500 was down 0.01% to 3,373.74, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.04% to 9,715.67. Among other stocks, Expedia Inc jumped 10.3% after the online travel services company forecast strong quarterly core earnings amid coronavirus uncertainties. EBay Inc advanced 1.5% as the ecommerce company added $3 billion to its 2020 share buyback plan and forecast profit above analysts’ expectations for the current quarter. U.S. financial markets are closed on Monday for President’s Day. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 1.32-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 1.09-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

Uncertainties surrounding the coronavirus epidemic and downbeat economic data had put a damper on investor sentiment for much of the day. But a CNBC report that the Trump administration could introduce a tax incentive for people earning less than $200,000 to invest up to $10,000 in U.S. stocks gave the markets a late boost. “In an election year, especially when the president is getting backlash that the tax cut benefits only the rich, seeking a way to democratize the stock market to low income earners would be a popular maneuver,” said Joseph Sroka, chief investment officer at NovaPoint in Atlanta.   While the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed modestly higher, the Dow lost ground. The three major stock averages headed into the U.S. holiday weekend having posted their second consecutive weekly advances. The coronavirus, now called Covid-19, has taken 1,380 lives and infected 63,851 people, according to Chinese authorities. In a recent Reuters survey of 40 economists, the respondents see China’s economy in the current quarter suffering its slowest growth since the financial crisis, but believe the downturn will be short-lived if the outbreak is contained. “The true economic implications of the coronavirus are still unknown,” Sroka said, adding “at the end of the day, earnings matter more for the sustainability of stocks than near-term headlines.”  Indeed, of the 387 companies in the S&P 500 having reported fourth-quarter results, 77.4% have surprised Wall Street expectations to the upside, according to Refinitiv data. Analysts now see fourth-quarter earnings rising at an annual pace of 2.6%, a striking reversal of the 0.3% decline seen on Jan 1.

Seven of the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500 closed in the black, with defensive real estate .SPLRCR and utilities .SPLRCU stocks seeing the biggest gains.  Energy shares .SPNY were the biggest losers. NVIDIA Corp (NVDA.O) jumped 7.0% after the chipmaker’s beat-and-raise earnings report, even as it forecast a $100 million hit from the coronavirus. Online travel services platform Expedia Inc (EXPE.O) surged 11.0% after the online travel services company forecast strong quarterly core earnings despite uncertainties surrounding the Covid-19 virus. EBay Inc (EBAY.O) gained 2.6% after providing better-than-expected current-quarter profit guidance.

A NVIDIA logo is shown at SIGGRAPH 2017 in Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 31, 2017.  REUTERS/Mike Blake/FilesNvidia was long known as a supplier of graphics chips for personal computers to make video games look more realistic, but researchers now also use its chips inside data centers to speed up artificial intelligence computing work such as training computers to recognize images.  To do so, Nvidia’s so-called accelerator chips work alongside central processors from companies such as Intel Corp and International Business Machines Corp. At a supercomputing conference held in Germany on Monday, Nvidia said its accelerator chips will work with Arm processors by the end of the year.  Arm, owned by Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, provides the underlying processor technology for the chips in most mobile phones. But companies such as Ampere Computing, headed by Intel’s former president, have been working to take those chips into data centers, where Intel’s chips are dominant. But Arm processors are different from Intel or IBM chips in that Arm itself does not make chips. Instead it licenses out the underlying technology so others can make chips with it.  Ian Buck, vice president of Nvidia’s accelerated computing unit, said the project to build a supercomputer with Arm will be a “heavy lift” from a technical perspective. But he said Nvidia undertook it because researchers in Europe and Japan want to develop super computing chips with Arm’s technology, essentially giving them a third option beyond IBM and Intel over which they can have more control. “That openness ... makes it very attractive,” Buck said of Arm’s technology during an interview with Reuters before the conference. “What makes Arm interesting, and why we’re announcing support is, is its ability to provide an open architecture for supercomputing.” The move to work with Arm on supercomputers follows Nvidia’s $6.8 billion deal to buy Israeli firm Mellanox Technologies. Mellanox makes high-speed networking chips that help stitch together many smaller computers into a larger one and is found in some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers.

The agreement between Volvo and Nvidia is a long-term partnership spanning several years, and work will begin immediately with personnel from the two companies being co-located in Gothenburg, Sweden and Santa Clara, California. Volvo said the partnership will focus on the development of a flexible, scalable autonomous driving system, which is planned to be used first in commercial pilot schemes before it is deployed in commercial vehicles from the Volvo Group, Volvo said. “Utilizing Nvidia’s end-to-end artificial intelligence platform for training, simulation and in-vehicle computing, the resulting system is designed to safely handle fully autonomous driving on public roads and highways,” Volvo said in a statement. Nvidia said it was thrilled to team up with Volvo. “The latest breakthroughs in AI and robotics bring a new level of intelligence and automation to address the transportation challenges we face,”  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said.

REUTERS/Denis BalibouseThe agreement announced on Tuesday by Nvidia and Volvo, the world’s second-biggest truckmaker after Daimler AG, is a long-term partnership spanning several years. Work will begin immediately in Santa Clara, California, and Gothenburg, Sweden. Financial terms were not disclosed. Volvo, which last year demonstrated its first cabin-less autonomous truck, Vera, said the partnership would develop a flexible, scalable self-driving system, which is planned to be used first in pilot schemes before commercial deployment. “The resulting system is designed to safely handle fully autonomous driving on public roads and highways,” Volvo said in a statement. Nvidia, known for its powerful gaming graphics chips, has been aggressively expanding into the automotive sphere, where trucks - with their regular routes that are easier to automate than cars navigating traffic - may lead the way in self-driving. Nvidia dominates the fast-growing AI chip market alongside Intel Corp. Tesla, Ford Motor Co, Daimler and several startups are racing each other towards autonomy, using closed-area pilots such as warehouse-to-warehouse delivery or mining-site operations to speed up testing and commercialization. Volvo’s first commercial autonomous technology will move into real operation from pilot mode in winter this year. Seven Volvo FH16 trucks will transport limestone for Norway’s Broennoey Kalk AS from a mine to a nearby port, Volvo Trucks’ autonomous solutions director, Sasko Cuklev said, on Tuesday. “This coming winter, Volvo Trucks’ autonomous mining solution will be in operation and we will get paid per transported tonne,” Cuklev said at the company’s annual general meeting in Gothenburg. He said the seven trucks, together with a site management system, truck services and support, workshop set-up and insurance would be wrapped together to make Volvo’s first commercial autonomous transport package.  Volvo Chief Technology Officer Lars Stenqvist said he preferred not to set a firm date for when a self-driving Volvo truck using Nvidia technology would travel a public highway. Deployment will start in areas that are not open to the public and “gradually grow into more complex situations,” he told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday. “We are humble as to the challenges we have.”     Morgan Stanley analysts said last month that Nvidia-backed startup TuSimple had secured 12 customers that were generating revenue. TuSimple last month said it had begun testing for the U.S. Postal Service. PILOT PROJECT Nvidia, which has previously announced technology partnerships with automakers including Volkswagen AG, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota Motor Corp , said it was thrilled to team up with Volvo.    “The latest breakthroughs in AI and robotics bring a new level of intelligence and automation to address the transportation challenges we face,”  Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told reporters on a conference call. Huang emphasized that for Nvidia the partnership with Volvo goes beyond supplying chips, and includes work on developing software, on-board computers and sensor systems for autonomous commercial vehicles. “The technology inside the vehicle is much more significant than we would apply” to a consumer-owned car, he said. Volvo said last week its Vera self-driving truck would begin transporting goods from a logistics center to a port terminal in Gothenburg in collaboration with logistics firm DFDS, in a first step towards operations on public roads. Systems designed under the partnership with Nvidia would be used to develop vehicles capable of operating on public streets, Stenqvist said. Nvidia’s so-called Drive Constellation chips often power the machine learning used to refine self-driving car software algorithms inside data centers, and the company has also been working to build its Drive chips into cars.

FILE PHOTO: A Volvo logo is pictured on the stand during the 87th International Motor Show at Palexpo in Geneva, Switzerland, March 7, 2017. REUTERS/Denis BalibouseThe agreement announced on Tuesday by Nvidia and Volvo, the world’s second-biggest truckmaker after Daimler AG, is a long-term partnership spanning several years. Work will begin immediately in Santa Clara, California, and Gothenburg, Sweden. Financial terms were not disclosed. Volvo, which last year demonstrated its first cabin-less autonomous truck, Vera, said the partnership would develop a flexible, scalable self-driving system, which is planned to be used first in pilot schemes before commercial deployment. “The resulting system is designed to safely handle fully autonomous driving on public roads and highways,” Volvo said in a statement. Nvidia, known for its powerful gaming graphics chips, has been aggressively expanding into the automotive sphere, where trucks - with their regular routes that are easier to automate than cars navigating traffic - may lead the way in self-driving. Nvidia dominates the fast-growing AI chip market alongside Intel Corp. Tesla, Ford Motor Co, Daimler and several startups are racing each other towards autonomy, using closed-area pilots such as warehouse-to-warehouse delivery or mining-site operations to speed up testing and commercialization. Volvo’s first commercial autonomous technology will move into real operation from pilot mode in winter this year. Seven Volvo FH16 trucks will transport limestone for Norway’s Broennoey Kalk AS from a mine to a nearby port, Volvo Trucks’ autonomous solutions director, Sasko Cuklev said, on Tuesday. “This coming winter, Volvo Trucks’ autonomous mining solution will be in operation and we will get paid per transported tonne,” Cuklev said at the company’s annual general meeting in Gothenburg. He said the seven trucks, together with a site management system, truck services and support, workshop set-up and insurance would be wrapped together to make Volvo’s first commercial autonomous transport package.  Volvo Chief Technology Officer Lars Stenqvist said he preferred not to set a firm date for when a self-driving Volvo truck using Nvidia technology would travel a public highway. Deployment will start in areas that are not open to the public and “gradually grow into more complex situations,” he told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday. “We are humble as to the challenges we have.”     Morgan Stanley analysts said last month that Nvidia-backed startup TuSimple had secured 12 customers that were generating revenue. TuSimple last month said it had begun testing for the U.S. Postal Service. PILOT PROJECT Nvidia, which has previously announced technology partnerships with automakers including Volkswagen AG, Mercedes-Benz and Toyota Motor Corp , said it was thrilled to team up with Volvo.    “The latest breakthroughs in AI and robotics bring a new level of intelligence and automation to address the transportation challenges we face,”  Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told reporters on a conference call. Huang emphasized that for Nvidia the partnership with Volvo goes beyond supplying chips, and includes work on developing software, on-board computers and sensor systems for autonomous commercial vehicles. “The technology inside the vehicle is much more significant than we would apply” to a consumer-owned car, he said. Volvo said last week its Vera self-driving truck would begin transporting goods from a logistics center to a port terminal in Gothenburg in collaboration with logistics firm DFDS, in a first step towards operations on public roads. Systems designed under the partnership with Nvidia would be used to develop vehicles capable of operating on public streets, Stenqvist said. Nvidia’s so-called Drive Constellation chips often power the machine learning used to refine self-driving car software algorithms inside data centers, and the company has also been working to build its Drive chips into cars.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/FilesNEW YORK (Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia Corp is nearing a deal to acquire peer Mellanox Technologies Ltd for more than $7 billion in cash, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday.      The deal would be Nvidia’s biggest-ever acquisition and boost its business of making chips for data centers, allowing it to reduce its reliance on the video game industry, for which it is best known as a major technology vendor.

The source asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.  Intel and Mellanox did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment. Financial news website Calcalist had reported earlier on Sunday that Nvidia had outbid Intel for Mellanox.     Mellanox’s chips power high-speed networks connecting servers. The company, which is based in Israel and the United States, had a market capitalization at the end of trading on Friday of about $5.9 billion.      Data center revenue accounts for nearly a third of Nvidia’s sales. Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California has grown at a rapid pace in the past few years, under CEO Jensen Huang, but a slowdown in China and a fading cyrptocurrency craze have started to weigh on its sales in recent quarters. In January, Nvidia, which has market capitalization of $91 billion, cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars because of weak demand for its gaming chips in China and lower-than-expected data center sales.  Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox would also represent a win for activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP, which is a shareholder of the company and reached a deal with it last year over the composition of its board.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu/FilesNEW YORK (Reuters) - Chipmaker Nvidia Corp is nearing a deal to acquire peer Mellanox Technologies Ltd for more than $7 billion in cash, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday.      The deal would be Nvidia’s biggest-ever acquisition and boost its business of making chips for data centers, allowing it to reduce its reliance on the video game industry, for which it is best known as a major technology vendor.     Nvidia has outbid Intel Corp in the auction for Mellanox and could announce a deal as early as Monday, the person said. The source asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.  Intel and Mellanox did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment. Financial news website Calcalist had reported earlier on Sunday that Nvidia had outbid Intel for Mellanox.     Mellanox’s chips power high-speed networks connecting servers. The company, which is based in Israel and the United States, had a market capitalization at the end of trading on Friday of about $5.9 billion.      Data center revenue accounts for nearly a third of Nvidia’s sales. Nvidia, based in Santa Clara, California has grown at a rapid pace in the past few years, under CEO Jensen Huang, but a slowdown in China and a fading cyrptocurrency craze have started to weigh on its sales in recent quarters. In January, Nvidia, which has market capitalization of $91 billion, cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars because of weak demand for its gaming chips in China and lower-than-expected data center sales.  Nvidia’s acquisition of Mellanox would also represent a win for activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP, which is a shareholder of the company and reached a deal with it last year over the composition of its board.

The three main Wall Street indexes are on track for their third week of decline, after the inversion of a U.S. yield curve on Wednesday pointed to a looming recession. China said overnight that it was planning to roll out stimulus to stymie an economic slowdown. Investors were also looking forward to interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank next month to fight softening economic growth. Among stocks, Nvidia Corp jumped 6% in premarket trading after posting better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue. Other semiconductor stocks, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Micron Technology Inc, Intel Corp, were up between 1.5% and 3.2%. At 7:02 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 251 points, or 0.98%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 28.5 points, or 1% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 96.75 points, or 1.29%. Upbeat U.S. retail sales data on Thursday overshadowed conflicting signals on trade. President Donald Trump said both sides were holding “productive” trade talks even as Beijing vowed to take necessary counter-measures to the latest round of tariffs on Chinese goods. The drawn-out trade war between the world’s largest economies and fears about its fallout on global growth have led to a more than 4% drop in the three main indexes this month. Interest-rate sensitive lenders, including Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and Morgan Stanley, rose above 1% as U.S. Treasury bond yields eased off their lows. The so-called FAANG group - which includes Facebook Inc , Amazon.com Inc, Apple, Netflix Inc and Google-parent Alphabet Inc - gained between 1.2% and 1.6%. Deere & Co shares fell 2.8% as the farm equipment maker cut its full-year profit and sales growth forecasts.

The logo of technology company Nvidia is seen at its headquarters in Santa Clara, California February 11, 2015. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File PhotoAt a gathering of graphics professionals on Monday, Nvidia rolled out its newest generation of chip technology, called Turing after the legendary British computer scientist Alan Turing.  The biggest selling point of the chips is an improvement in so-called “ray tracing,” or the ability for the chip to simulate how light rays will bounce around in a visual scene. That task takes so much computing power that designers have to wait while a chip churns through the data to see the results of their work. Nvidia says the new generation of chips will let designers make those changes in real time, which could speed up the creative process - and which Nvidia hopes customers will pay a premium for. “Turing is Nvidia’s most important innovation in computer graphics in more than a decade,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement. The Santa Clara, California-based company’s shares have risen more than 50 percent over the past year, backed by data center chip sales that more than doubled to $1.9 billion its last fiscal year. Nvidia’s data center chips power artificial intelligence tasks training computers to recognize images and are increasingly eating away Intel Corp’s (INTC.O) growth opportunities. And Nvidia’s biggest business, its consumer chips that let video gamers play with improved graphics, grew 35 percent to $5.5 billion in its most recent fiscal year. That growth came from hot gaming titles such Epic Games’ Fortnite and the fact that the chips were adopted by homespun cryptocurrency enthusiasts. But Nvidia’s middle line of chips, aimed at graphics and design professionals who make films and other digital content, has not fared nearly as well, growing only 11.8 percent last year to $934 million. Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights and Strategy and a former chip executive, said Nvidia is likely looking to stave off competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O), which is likely to target the same group of professional users with its new graphics chips next year. Nvidia’s existing strength in the data center market and the high-end gaming market have left it most open to attack in the middle of the market. “Where Nvidia gets the biggest bump right now (from a new chip generation) is in the workstation market, which makes it all that more competitive,” Moorhead said.

A NVIDIA graphics card is shown in a gaming computer in Encinitas, California, U.S., August 14, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Blake/FilesWith new software it calls RAPIDS, Nvidia is hoping to move beyond the fast-growing but relatively small market for artificial intelligence chips. It’s aiming for the much larger market for chips that do basic business data crunching such as forecasting inventories. Nvidia announced the software at a conference in Germany. Nvidia got its start in the 1990s with graphics processors to make video games look more realistic. But in recent years its chips have become used as so-called “accelerators” in data centers to speed up artificial intelligence work, like training computers to recognize images or human speech. Nvidia’s processors are not direct replacements for Intel’s general purpose computing chips. But when businesses use a lot of Nvidia’s chips, they often buy Intel’s chips at a slower rate. Nvidia’s strong position in the artificial intelligence field came from its software efforts rather than its chips alone. About a decade ago, Nvidia created a platform that would let developers program its chips for a wide range of tasks rather than just video game graphics. Artificial intelligence researchers embraced it. But for all the buzz artificial intelligence generates, other types of computing - like perfecting analytical models for more accurate inventory forecasts - are more common in businesses. Nvidia’s new software aims to speed up that kind of work. Nvidia has teamed up with a range of companies, including Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Oracle Corp and a branch of International Business Machines, to release the new tools. They are being used by Walmart Inc, Nvidia said. “It’s really an ecosystem we’re trying to build out,” Jeff Tseng, head of product for artificial intelligence infrastructure at Nvidia, told Reuters in an interview. But Nvidia will have a tough fight against Intel, whose chips are already the industry standard for business analytics work. The key will be for Nvidia to find early customers for whom the speed benefits outweigh the cost of new chips, said Stephen O’Grady, an industry analyst with RedMonk “In many cases where we’re talking about basic data science, it’s going to be computationally faster,” he said. “This is their big play to get into the general purpose data science side of things.” Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Cynthia OstermanOur Standards:The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.0 : 0narrow-browser-and-phonemedium-browser-and-portrait-tabletlandscape-tabletmedium-wide-browserwide-browser-and-largermedium-browser-and-landscape-tabletmedium-wide-browser-and-largerabove-phoneportrait-tablet-and-aboveabove-portrait-tabletlandscape-tablet-and-abovelandscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browserportrait-tablet-and-belowlandscape-tablet-and-belowAppsNewslettersAdvertise with UsAdvertising GuidelinesCookiesTerms of UsePrivacyDo Not Sell My Personal InformationAll quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.

The logo of technology company Nvidia is seen at its headquarters in Santa Clara, California February 11, 2015. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/File PhotoAt a gathering of graphics professionals on Monday, Nvidia rolled out its newest generation of chip technology, called Turing after the legendary British computer scientist Alan Turing.  The biggest selling point of the chips is an improvement in so-called “ray tracing,” or the ability for the chip to simulate how light rays will bounce around in a visual scene. That task takes so much computing power that designers have to wait while a chip churns through the data to see the results of their work. Nvidia says the new generation of chips will let designers make those changes in real time, which could speed up the creative process - and which Nvidia hopes customers will pay a premium for. “Turing is Nvidia’s most important innovation in computer graphics in more than a decade,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement. The Santa Clara, California-based company’s shares have risen more than 50 percent over the past year, backed by data center chip sales that more than doubled to $1.9 billion its last fiscal year. Nvidia’s data center chips power artificial intelligence tasks training computers to recognize images and are increasingly eating away Intel Corp’s (INTC.O) growth opportunities. And Nvidia’s biggest business, its consumer chips that let video gamers play with improved graphics, grew 35 percent to $5.5 billion in its most recent fiscal year. That growth came from hot gaming titles such Epic Games’ Fortnite and the fact that the chips were adopted by homespun cryptocurrency enthusiasts. But Nvidia’s middle line of chips, aimed at graphics and design professionals who make films and other digital content, has not fared nearly as well, growing only 11.8 percent last year to $934 million. Patrick Moorhead, an analyst with Moor Insights and Strategy and a former chip executive, said Nvidia is likely looking to stave off competition from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.O), which is likely to target the same group of professional users with its new graphics chips next year. Nvidia’s existing strength in the data center market and the high-end gaming market have left it most open to attack in the middle of the market. “Where Nvidia gets the biggest bump right now (from a new chip generation) is in the workstation market, which makes it all that more competitive,” Moorhead said.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo/File Photo(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it plans to roll out a version of its cloud-based software that will be modified to suit the needs of healthcare organizations. While Microsoft is known for general productivity software such as Outlook and the chat app Teams, it also makes more specialized business software such as programs used by customer service agents and artificial intelligence tools that software developers can use to make chat bots. Microsoft said it will pull all of its technologies together into a package it calls “Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare.” The system will allow hospitals to maintain data throughout an interaction with a patient. For example, a patient might first visit a health care organization’s patient portal website. The initial questions would be answered by a chatbot that has been programmed by health care professionals, but then handed off to a service agent who could ask more questions and schedule a virtual visit with a nurse or doctor. That visit could then be held over Microsoft Teams video chat. If the patient then comes to a clinic in person for a follow-up visit, all the data from the previous interactions will be available to the health care professional who sees the patient. “We want to carry all that information through the health experience,” Deb Cupp, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of enterprise and commercial industries, told Reuters in an interview.  Microsoft also said it plans to make the system work with electronic health record software providers such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc.  Microsoft said it aims to offer the healthcare system as a free trial over the next six months. It also plans more industry-specific cloud software offerings in the future, but it did not say which industries it planned to target.

While Microsoft is known for general productivity software such as Outlook and the chat app Teams, it also makes more specialized business software such as programs used by customer service agents and artificial intelligence tools that software developers can use to make chat bots. Microsoft said it will pull all of its technologies together into a package it calls “Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare.” The system will allow hospitals to maintain data throughout an interaction with a patient. For example, a patient might first visit a health care organization’s patient portal website. The initial questions would be answered by a chatbot that has been programmed by health care professionals, but then handed off to a service agent who could ask more questions and schedule a virtual visit with a nurse or doctor. That visit could then be held over Microsoft Teams video chat. If the patient then comes to a clinic in person for a follow-up visit, all the data from the previous interactions will be available to the health care professional who sees the patient. “We want to carry all that information through the health experience,” Deb Cupp, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of enterprise and commercial industries, told Reuters in an interview.  Microsoft also said it plans to make the system work with electronic health record software providers such as Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc.  Microsoft said it aims to offer the healthcare system as a free trial over the next six months. It also plans more industry-specific cloud software offerings in the future, but it did not say which industries it planned to target.

Microsoft said it had signed an agreement with domestic cloud provider Chmura Krajowa (National Cloud) to provide cloud services in Poland, as the central European country seeks to position itself as a regional centre for technology. “I deeply believe that Microsoft’s investment in Poland will be important for enterprises, public institutions and the education system and will enable them to digitally transform and implement new work standards,” Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said in a statement.  Chmura Krajowa (National Cloud) was formed in 2018 by Poland’s largest bank, PKO Bank Polski, and the Polish Development Fund (PFR) with the aim of speeding up the digitalisation of businesses and the public administration, according to its website.

A Microsoft logo is seen in Los Angeles, California U.S. November 7, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/FilesThe company’s shares, up over 12% this year, rose about 5% in extended trading. The results reflect Chief Executive Satya Nadella’s focus over his six-year tenure on cloud computing, in which companies tap Microsoft’s data centers for computing power - a growing business dominated by Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft gave business-unit forecasts that were below analyst estimates, predicting tough times for LinkedIn and some small-business software sales. “Ultimately, Microsoft is not immune from what is going on broadly in the world in terms of GDP growth,” Nadella said on a conference call with investors. But results benefited from sales of its Windows operating system and Surface hardware devices as people upgraded personal computers to work or study from home. Microsoft also cited all-time-high engagement on its Xbox Live gaming service, with 90 million monthly active users. “The biggest missed opportunity was in Surface, where demand was huge, the channel inventory was depleted, and supply chain constraints reduced finished goods output,” said Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead. “I believe the company could have easily sold 15-20% more if available.” Microsoft also benefited from strong demand for its Teams collaboration software, which Nadella said on a conference call now has 75 million daily active users and competes with Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O) and Slack Technologies Inc (WORK.N). The demand influx strained Microsoft’s data centers, forcing it to limit new cloud customers’ usage and prioritize healthcare and government users. In an interview, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said some of the increased Teams usage came from subscribers with access to the software as part of a broader package and turned it on for the first time. In other cases, Hood said, Microsoft offered Teams in a free trial to large customers. “In those instances, you also won’t see revenue, but seeing great usage obviously is terrific for us longer term if people want to convert that to a paying seat,” Hood said. “While I’m really excited about the long-term potential for revenue, you won’t see it in this (fiscal third) quarter, or really even in Q4. It’s more about people being more and more engaged with Microsoft products.” Responding to analysts’ questions, Microsoft executives declined to specify when they would start charging Teams customers on free trials. “Immediate term, we are mostly building out the relationships, adding new customers, adding intensity and usage in existing relationships,” Nadella said on the call. Third-quarter sales were helped by demand for cloud services. However, Azure growth slowed to 59% from 62% in the second quarter, which company officials said was a result of how large the business has become. “Despite the slowed growth, (Azure) operates at approximately 10 times the scale of Google (by annual revenues) and has seen better enterprise adoption so far,” said Daniel Elman, an analyst at Nucleus Research. Microsoft said revenue for its “commercial cloud,” a combination of Azure and the cloud-based versions of software such as Office, rose 39% to $13.3 billion. The business’ gross profit margin, a key measure of cloud profitability that Microsoft has told investors it expects to improve, was 67% versus 63% last year. Microsoft also said capital expenditure was $3.9 billion, up from $3.4 billion a year earlier and less than the $4.5 billion the previous quarter. However, Hood told Reuters that supply chain constraints due to the coronavirus pandemic had delayed some spending to build Azure data centers, which will likely be higher next quarter as the company works to catch up. Revenue in the Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, rose 27% to $12.28 billion, beating analysts’ consensus estimate of $11.87 billion according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue rose 15% to $35.02 billion in the third quarter ending March 31, beating estimates of $33.66 billion. (bit.ly/3f1Yeu3) Net income rose to $10.75 billion, or $1.40 per share, from $8.81 billion, or $1.14 per share, a year earlier.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File PhotoMILAN (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. said on Friday it would create its first datacentre region in Italy under a $1.5 billion investment plan as the U.S. company expands its cloud computing services to more locations across the world.  Microsoft’s rival Amazon Web Services last week opened a datacentre region in Milan, while in March Google’s Inc sealed a partnership with former phone monopoly Telecom Italia to expand cloud business operations in Italy.    Analysts expect the Italian cloud market to grow at a double digit pace in the next few years as companies, which have embraced smartworking during the coronavirus crisis, will increasingly rely on digital processes for their business.  Jean-Philippe Courtois, Microsoft’s head of global sales, marketing and operations, said the company saw enormous potential to accelerate innovation through cloud services.  The new datacentre region will be based in the Milan area, joining Microsoft’s other 60 regions announced globally. In February, Microsoft announced plans to open a new datacentre region in Spain and earlier this week the company said it would invest $1 billion in Poland as part of plans to open a data centre to provide cloud services to businesses and institutions. Also in Italy, Microsoft, under a five-year plan, will provide access to local cloud services and launch digital skilling and smart-working and artificial intelligence programs for small and medium enterprises. The company will also expand its technology partnership with state-controlled postal operator Poste Italiane, helping the company to accelerate its digital transformation.

A Microsoft logo is seen in Los Angeles, California U.S. November 7, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/FilesThe company’s shares, up over 12% this year, rose about 5% in extended trading. The results reflect Chief Executive Satya Nadella’s focus over his six-year tenure on cloud computing, in which companies tap Microsoft’s data centers for computing power - a growing business dominated by Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) Amazon Web Services. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft gave business-unit forecasts that were below analyst estimates, predicting tough times for LinkedIn and some small-business software sales. “Ultimately, Microsoft is not immune from what is going on broadly in the world in terms of GDP growth,” Nadella said on a conference call with investors. But results benefited from sales of its Windows operating system and Surface hardware devices as people upgraded personal computers to work or study from home. Microsoft also cited all-time-high engagement on its Xbox Live gaming service, with 90 million monthly active users. “The biggest missed opportunity was in Surface, where demand was huge, the channel inventory was depleted, and supply chain constraints reduced finished goods output,” said Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Patrick Moorhead. “I believe the company could have easily sold 15-20% more if available.” Microsoft also benefited from strong demand for its Teams collaboration software, which Nadella said on a conference call now has 75 million daily active users and competes with Zoom Video Communications Inc (ZM.O) and Slack Technologies Inc (WORK.N). The demand influx strained Microsoft’s data centers, forcing it to limit new cloud customers’ usage and prioritize healthcare and government users. In an interview, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said some of the increased Teams usage came from subscribers with access to the software as part of a broader package and turned it on for the first time. In other cases, Hood said, Microsoft offered Teams in a free trial to large customers. “In those instances, you also won’t see revenue, but seeing great usage obviously is terrific for us longer term if people want to convert that to a paying seat,” Hood said. “While I’m really excited about the long-term potential for revenue, you won’t see it in this (fiscal third) quarter, or really even in Q4. It’s more about people being more and more engaged with Microsoft products.” Responding to analysts’ questions, Microsoft executives declined to specify when they would start charging Teams customers on free trials. “Immediate term, we are mostly building out the relationships, adding new customers, adding intensity and usage in existing relationships,” Nadella said on the call. Third-quarter sales were helped by demand for cloud services. However, Azure growth slowed to 59% from 62% in the second quarter, which company officials said was a result of how large the business has become. “Despite the slowed growth, (Azure) operates at approximately 10 times the scale of Google (by annual revenues) and has seen better enterprise adoption so far,” said Daniel Elman, an analyst at Nucleus Research. Microsoft said revenue for its “commercial cloud,” a combination of Azure and the cloud-based versions of software such as Office, rose 39% to $13.3 billion. The business’ gross profit margin, a key measure of cloud profitability that Microsoft has told investors it expects to improve, was 67% versus 63% last year. Microsoft also said capital expenditure was $3.9 billion, up from $3.4 billion a year earlier and less than the $4.5 billion the previous quarter. However, Hood told Reuters that supply chain constraints due to the coronavirus pandemic had delayed some spending to build Azure data centers, which will likely be higher next quarter as the company works to catch up. Revenue in the Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure, rose 27% to $12.28 billion, beating analysts’ consensus estimate of $11.87 billion according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue rose 15% to $35.02 billion in the third quarter ending March 31, beating estimates of $33.66 billion. (bit.ly/3f1Yeu3) Net income rose to $10.75 billion, or $1.40 per share, from $8.81 billion, or $1.14 per share, a year earlier.

The company posted the correction in a blog late Monday, which was originally posted on March 28. Microsoft did not provide any details on growth in cloud services in virus affected regions in the latest blog update. It did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The companies did not disclose the size of the deal but said it will include Dynamics 365, a suite of Microsoft tools that competes directly with Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N).  Microsoft has a stronghold in general-purpose business software such as email and word processing apps but has been working to win more customers for its specialized software such as apps used by customer service and sales employees. James Phillips, the corporate vice president for Microsoft’s business applications group, told Reuters in an interview that Coca-Cola will use Microsoft technology to pull together information several internal systems, using artificial intelligence to fetch data from them and answer questions. In the first phase, Phillips said, Coke will offer the system internally to employees “rather than making the employee understand that you need to go over here to request vacation time, over there to look at your last payroll slip, or to some other system to understand what educational courses may be available.” Barry Simpson, senior vice president and chief information and integrated services officer of Coca-Cola, said in a statement that Microsoft’s software would help the company by “replacing previously disparate and fragmented systems.” Eventually, Microsoft’s Phillips said, Coca-Cola’s customer service agents plan to use system to help quickly answer questions from the beverage maker’s customers, which include major retailers and grocers.

Microsoft’s rival Amazon Web Services last week opened a datacentre region in Milan, while in March Google’s Inc sealed a parternership with former phone monopoly Telecom Italia to expand cloud business operations in Italy. Analysts expect the Italian cloud market to grow at a double digit pace in the next few years as companies, which have embraced smartworking during the coronavirus crisis, will increasingly rely on digital processes for their business. Jean-Philippe Courtois, Microsoft’s head of global sales, marketing and operations, said the company saw enormous potential to accelerate innovation through cloud services. The new datacentre region will be based in the Milan area, joining Microsoft’s other 60 regions announced globally. In February, Microsoft announced plans to open a new datacentre region in Spain and earlier this week the company said it would invest $1 billion in Poland as part of plans to open a data centre to provide cloud services to businesses and institutions. Also in Italy, Microsoft, under a five-year plan, will provide access to local cloud services and launch digital skilling and smart-working and artificial intelligence programmes for small and medium enterprises. The company will also expand its technology partnership with state-controlled postal operator Poste Italiane, helping the company to accelerate its digital transformation.

REUTERS/Sergio Perez/File PhotoJAKARTA (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is keen to invest in data centres in Indonesia which will soon make regulatory changes to facilitate the move, the country’s president said after meeting with the software giant’s CEO on Thursay. Indonesia’s digital economy is the largest and fastest-growing in Southeast Asia and expected to reach some $130 billion by 2025 compared with $40 billion last year, according to a report by Google, Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings and Bain & Company. “Microsoft wants to invest immediately in Indonesia,” President Joko Widodo told reporters after giving a speech at an event celebrating 25 years of the company’s presence in Southeast Asia’s largest economy. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also attended the event. “So within a week we will decide a new, simple regulation to support the investment,” Widodo said, without elaborating on what the regulation might be or the size of the potential investment. Indonesia’s government submitted a bill to parliament in January aimed at protecting consumer data in the digital era, but that has yet to be approved. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

India’s southern city of Hyderabad, where Nadella grew up, is home to Microsoft’s biggest research and development center outside of the United States. Nadella is planning to be in India between Feb. 24 and Feb. 26 and will likely visit New Delhi, tech hub Bengaluru and the financial capital of Mumbai, two people familiar with the plans said. He is also likely to meet senior Indian industry leaders during his visit, the sources said. The sources did not want to be identified because the company has yet to make a public announcement. Microsoft declined to comment when asked about a visit. “We don’t have anything to share at the moment,” a company spokeswoman said. Microsoft also is trying arrange for Nadella to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one of the sources added, although the meeting has yet to be confirmed. The Prime Minister’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Nadella last month stoked controversy in India when he was quoted by Buzzfeed as saying here a new law implemented by Modi's government that eases the path to citizenship for non-Muslims in nearby nations was ""just bad"".   His comments drew sharp criticism from Modi’s ruling party. Microsoft issued a statement later quoting Nadella as saying that every country has the right to protect and define its borders.     A visit by Nadella would be in the midst of the government taking a tougher stance against foreign technology companies competing in the domestic market by drafting laws aimed at more tightly-controlled cross-border data flows. The visit would also be a month after Amazon.com Inc CEO Jeff Bezos made a trip to the country and was snubbed by senior members of the government. India has taken a hard stance against the U.S. e-commerce sector, with Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart facing an antitrust probe and criticism from brick-and-mortar traders against their business practices. When Bezos visited India last month and announced a new $1 billion investment, India’s trade minister brushed him off by saying Amazon was doing no “great favor” to India.

The Redmond, Washington-based software giant said it would continue to serve customers online, with team members working remotely from corporate facilities. A Microsoft spokeswoman told Reuters all current retail employees would be given an opportunity to remain with the company in different roles. “Speaking over 120 languages, their diversity reflects the many communities we serve,” Microsoft Corporate Vice President David Porter said of the company’s retail employees in a statement. “Our commitment to growing and developing careers from this talent pool is stronger than ever.”The company also said it will rethink other spaces that serve all customers, including operating Microsoft Experience Centers in London, New York, Sydney, and Redmond campus locations. “This is a tough but smart strategic decision for (CEO) Nadella & Co. to make at this point. The physical stores generated negligible retail revenue for Microsoft and ultimately everything was moving more and more towards the digital channels over the last few years,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note.

The migration to the Microsoft Azure cloud platform will take place over many months and Aladdin users are not expected to see any impact in the near term, BlackRock said. “Aladdin infrastructure deployed on Microsoft Azure’s cloud platform will provide BlackRock with enhanced capabilities to deliver the best outcomes for our Aladdin clients,” Rob Goldstein, chief operating officer at BlackRock, said in a statement.

India’s southern city of Hyderabad, where Nadella grew up, is home to Microsoft’s biggest research and development center outside of the United States. Nadella is planning to be in India between Feb. 24 and Feb. 26 and will likely visit New Delhi, tech hub Bengaluru and the financial capital of Mumbai, two people familiar with the plans said. He is also likely to meet senior Indian industry leaders during his visit, the sources said. The sources did not want to be identified because the company has yet to make a public announcement. Microsoft declined to comment when asked about a visit. “We don’t have anything to share at the moment,” a company spokeswoman said. Microsoft also is trying arrange for Nadella to meet Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, one of the sources added, although the meeting has yet to be confirmed. The Prime Minister’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Nadella last month stoked controversy in India when he was quoted by Buzzfeed as saying here a new law implemented by Modi's government that eases the path to citizenship for non-Muslims in nearby nations was ""just bad"".   His comments drew sharp criticism from Modi’s ruling party. Microsoft issued a statement later quoting Nadella as saying that every country has the right to protect and define its borders.     A visit by Nadella would be in the midst of the government taking a tougher stance against foreign technology companies competing in the domestic market by drafting laws aimed at more tightly-controlled cross-border data flows. The visit would also be a month after Amazon.com Inc CEO Jeff Bezos made a trip to the country and was snubbed by senior members of the government. India has taken a hard stance against the U.S. e-commerce sector, with Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart facing an antitrust probe and criticism from brick-and-mortar traders against their business practices. When Bezos visited India last month and announced a new $1 billion investment, India’s trade minister brushed him off by saying Amazon was doing no “great favor” to India.

Shares of the world’s largest software company hit an all-time high in after-hours trading. The results reflected the approach of Chief Executive Satya Nadella, who for five years has re-centred Microsoft around the cloud, renting out its computing power and technology to large businesses. Microsoft said Azure, its primary competitor to Amazon’s cloud, grew 62% in the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, down from a 76% revenue growth rate the year before but up from 59% in the fiscal first quarter. Microsoft’s chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said increased consumption of Azure services, which include offerings such as computing power to run applications and data storage services, drove the revenue growth. “We did have good usage, which matters a ton to that number,” Hood told Reuters. “The core thing that we focused on - which is consumption growth - was quite good.” Microsoft said revenue for its “commercial cloud” - a combination of Azure and the cloud-based versions of software such as Office - reached $12.5 billion, up from $9 billion the year before. The commercial cloud gross profit margin - a key measure of cloud profitability that Microsoft has told investors it expects to improve - was 67%, versus 62% the year before. Microsoft shares rose as much as 4.58% to $175.74 in after-hours trading. “This quarter was an absolute ‘blow out quarter’ across the board with no blemishes and in our opinion speaks to an inflection point in deal flow as more enterprises pick Redmond for the cloud,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note, referring to Microsoft’s headquarters location in Redmond, Washington. Hood said the company was working to improve margins on its core Azure services, which rely on data centres that can cost billions of dollars to build. She cited “hardware improvements and taking advantage of those hardware improvements.” Microsoft’s revenue and profit for the second quarter were $36.9 billion and $1.51 per share, respectively, compared with analyst estimates of $35.7 billion and $1.32 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Microsoft has focused on hybrid cloud computing – in which a business can use a mix of Microsoft’s data centres and its own – as well as on delivering its longstanding productivity programs such as Office via the cloud. The shift to the cloud has driven Microsoft’s shares up more than 50% in the past year, as it gains ground against market leader Amazon and also parries the threats to its classic software programs from newer entrants like Alphabet Inc’s Google. In 2019, Microsoft had 22% share of the cloud computing infrastructure market, compared with 45% at Amazon and 5% from Google, according to data from Forrester Research. “Azure’s renewed growth doesn’t yet pose a threat to AWS’s supremacy in the cloud market, but it does present an opportunity to further close the gap on Amazon and increase its lead over other cloud providers,” said Andrew MacMillen of Nucleus Research. The company’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure, reported revenue that rose 27% to $11.9 billion in the quarter, versus expectations of $11.4 billion. For the fiscal third quarter ending in March, Microsoft forecast revenue with a midpoint of $11.9 billion for the unit, compared with analyst expectations of $11.4 billion.

Revenue in the unit that contains Windows was $13.2 billion, compared with estimates of $12.8 billion. Over the past year, Windows sales were hampered by shortages of PC chips from Intel Corp, but the chipmaker said last week it had alleviated most of those supply concerns. Microsoft forecast revenue of between $10.75 billion (8.2 billion pounds) and $11.15 billion for the unit containing Windows in the fiscal third quarter, a wider-than-normal forecast range that the company said was because of uncertainty surrounding the spread of the coronavirus in China.

Shares of the world’s largest software company hit an all-time high in after-hours trading. The results reflected the approach of Chief Executive Satya Nadella, who for five years has re-centred Microsoft around the cloud, renting out its computing power and technology to large businesses. Microsoft said Azure, its primary competitor to Amazon’s cloud, grew 62% in the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, down from a 76% revenue growth rate the year before but up from 59% in the fiscal first quarter. Microsoft’s chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said increased consumption of Azure services, which include offerings such as computing power to run applications and data storage services, drove the revenue growth. “We did have good usage, which matters a ton to that number,” Hood told Reuters. “The core thing that we focused on - which is consumption growth - was quite good.” Microsoft said revenue for its “commercial cloud” - a combination of Azure and the cloud-based versions of software such as Office - reached $12.5 billion, up from $9 billion the year before. The commercial cloud gross profit margin - a key measure of cloud profitability that Microsoft has told investors it expects to improve - was 67%, versus 62% the year before. Microsoft shares rose as much as 4.58% to $175.74 in after-hours trading. “This quarter was an absolute ‘blow out quarter’ across the board with no blemishes and in our opinion speaks to an inflection point in deal flow as more enterprises pick Redmond for the cloud,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note, referring to Microsoft’s headquarters location in Redmond, Washington. Hood said the company was working to improve margins on its core Azure services, which rely on data centres that can cost billions of dollars to build. She cited “hardware improvements and taking advantage of those hardware improvements.” Microsoft’s revenue and profit for the second quarter were $36.9 billion and $1.51 per share, respectively, compared with analyst estimates of $35.7 billion and $1.32 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Microsoft has focused on hybrid cloud computing – in which a business can use a mix of Microsoft’s data centres and its own – as well as on delivering its longstanding productivity programs such as Office via the cloud. The shift to the cloud has driven Microsoft’s shares up more than 50% in the past year, as it gains ground against market leader Amazon and also parries the threats to its classic software programs from newer entrants like Alphabet Inc’s Google. In 2019, Microsoft had 22% share of the cloud computing infrastructure market, compared with 45% at Amazon and 5% from Google, according to data from Forrester Research. “Azure’s renewed growth doesn’t yet pose a threat to AWS’s supremacy in the cloud market, but it does present an opportunity to further close the gap on Amazon and increase its lead over other cloud providers,” said Andrew MacMillen of Nucleus Research. The company’s Intelligent Cloud unit, which includes Azure, reported revenue that rose 27% to $11.9 billion in the quarter, versus expectations of $11.4 billion.

The Redmond, Washington-based software giant said would continue to serve customers online, with team members working remotely from corporate facilities. It was not immediately clear if Microsoft’s move would lead to any layoffs. The company also said it will rethink other spaces that serve all customers, including operating Microsoft Experience Centers in London, New York City, Sydney, and Redmond campus locations. “This is a tough, but smart strategic decision for (CEO) Nadella & Co. to make at this point. The physical stores generated negligible retail revenue for Microsoft and ultimately everything was moving more and more towards the digital channels over the last few years,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note. Retailers, whose stores shuttered in mid-March due to coronavirus-led lockdowns, have seen a huge surge in online demand amid stay-at-home orders.

REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp’s (MSFT.O) India-born Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said he was saddened by a new citizenship law based on religion that was recently implemented in his home country, BuzzFeed News reported on Monday.   ""I think what is happening is sad, primarily as sort of someone who grew up there... I think it's just bad,"" Nadella told here BuzzFeed at a Microsoft event in Manhattan.     Nadella grew up in Hyderabad, a technology hub in India that is home to the biggest Microsoft research and development centre outside of the United States.  India’s Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which eases the path for non-Muslims in the neighbouring Muslim-majority nations of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh to gain citizenship, has triggered weeks of sometimes violent protests in the world’s second most populous country. If combined with a proposed national register of citizens, critics of the CAA fear it will discriminate against India’s Muslim minority and chip away at its secular constitution. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The company's India Twitter handle here put out a statement quoting Nadella as saying he was shaped by ""growing up in a multicultural India"" and his ""immigrant experience in the United States"". “My hope is for an India where an immigrant can aspire to found a prosperous start-up or lead a multinational corporation benefitting Indian society and the economy at large.” Nadella and Microsoft were among the top trending topics on Twitter in India.

Amazon, which was seen as a favorite for the contract, plans to file a motion for a temporary restraining order on Jan. 24 and a federal court will issue its decision on Feb. 11, according to the filing. The e-commerce giant has blamed U.S. President Donald Trump of exerting “improper pressure” and bias that led the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to award the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure Cloud (JEDI) contract to Microsoft. The Department of Defense has stood by its decision, with its Secretary Mark Esper rejecting any suggestion of bias and saying the decision was conducted freely and fairly, without any outside influence. The JEDI contract is part of a broader digital modernization of the Pentagon meant to make it more technologically agile. Specifically, a goal of JEDI is to give the military better access to data and the cloud from battlefields and other remote locations. Microsoft did not have a comment on Amazon’s intent to file the motion. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment and the DoD could not be immediately reached.
